They've included several bundles of code libraries for databases and more importantly interfacing with the Facebook API. In order to efficiently host users' applications, AppJet has developed their own application virtualization system. The system allocates processor time to active applications and cuts off greedy ones after running an alloted number of compiled lines of code to prevent abuse.\n\nAppJet as a dev platform seems no longer to be active.

Glide will bring app development out of the Dark Ages, making it web-based, collaborative, and fun. Think of Google Docs or Figma but for building apps.\r\n\r\nWe believe that almost all apps can be built 10-100x faster, with higher quality, by starting with the data model and generating a polished app from high-level components that users customize.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to make it easy and fun for anyone to build amazing apps without code. In ten years, we want the majority of apps worldwide to have been built with Glide.\r\n\r\nWe're four technical founders with expertise in native mobile frameworks, developer tools, and product design. We've worked together for 5-10 years, and were all early employees at Xamarin, a mobile developer tools startup acquired by Microsoft in 2016.",

We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them.

    "long_description": "Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system 🚛 🌎🌱.\r\n\r\nToday, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. \r\n\r\nWith this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. \r\n\r\nOur product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. \r\n\r\nThe company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).\r\n",

As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\r\n\r\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \r\n\r\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.\r\n",

It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone’s needs, but it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there.\r\n\r\nAs companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools.\r\n\r\nWe are building an “internal developer platform” out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nWe do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.\r\n\r\nWe operate on our customers code and in your Cloud environment, so they never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we’ll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster when you want.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

And they’re working with a single agent and context window instead of one in every cell.\r\n\r\nAnd Riveter’s web browsing can go further—even reading PDFs and images that may contain answers. \r\n\r\nMost teams still spend hours (or hire UpWorkers/contractors) to manually copy product specs, check competitor pricing, pull custom KYB/KYC data to assess customer risk, or scrape filings. Or they spend months building web scrapers, and when that still doesn't work, they come to Riveter.\r\n\r\nOur founding team brings deep product and engineering expertise from to YC-backed companies Gusto, Retool, and Middesk.",

This ensures that every team member stays aligned and informed, reducing inefficiencies and enabling faster iterations. \r\n\r\nWith AI at our core, users can analyze hundreds of pages of existing engineering documentation and requirements to generate or retrieve information about the system model they are building in Dalus.\r\n\r\nWe started working together on Dalus in spring 2024 after Eliot quit his job at Aerojet Rocketdyne (L3Harris) where he worked as a test/systems engineer. He experienced first-hand how silos and poor communication reduced the productivity and efficiencies in the teams he worked at.\r\n\r\nWe love working with companies tackling complex engineering systems, whether they be startups just getting their feet wet or large organizations like Israel Aerospace Industries (Our design partner and biggest aerospace/defense company from Israel)\r\n\r\nRead why we started Dalus: https://dalus.io/articles/why-dalus",

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15). Having experienced the pain of slow builds firsthand across hundreds of production codebases, we're building the solution we've always wanted.",

A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

    "long_description": "Floot lets non-coders & entrepreneurs build real web apps that actually work. We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.\r\n\r\n✨ Try building an app at floot.com\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

    "long_description": "stagewise builds an open-source frontend coding agent for real codebases. We enable backend devs, designers and product managers to build pretty and functional web apps in a simple and visually guided manner - no matter the used tech stack.\r\n\r\nstagewise lives right inside your browser, makes changes in your local codebase and is compatible with all kinds of frameworks and setups - allowing it to be retrofitted into any existing project. Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built.",

It provides suggestions and recommendations for each question, making sure we have thought about everything early on. \r\n• Validations: Once the questions are answered, we consolidate them into a document and run parallel agents to once again find issues, contradictions, or areas of improvement. \r\n• BOM Generation: Our AI splits the scope into a block diagram and generates a Bill of Materials (BOM) for each by parsing diagrams and tables from datasheets, getting price and lead time data from top vendors, and internal vendor communications. \r\n• Versioning & Parallel Agents: You can branch designs and use parallel agents to simulate multiple architectures simultaneously, revealing quantitative tradeoffs in cost, price, and lead times \r\n\r\nWe met during our first week of college and became roommates at Berkeley, and are excited to make physical innovation easier!\r\n",
