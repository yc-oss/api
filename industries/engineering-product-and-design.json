They've included several bundles of code libraries for databases and more importantly interfacing with the Facebook API. In order to efficiently host users' applications, AppJet has developed their own application virtualization system. The system allocates processor time to active applications and cuts off greedy ones after running an alloted number of compiled lines of code to prevent abuse.\n\nAppJet as a dev platform seems no longer to be active.

Think of Google Docs or Figma but for building apps.\r\n\r\nWe believe that almost all apps can be built 10-100x faster, with higher quality, by starting with the data model and generating a polished app from high-level components that users customize.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to make it easy and fun for anyone to build amazing apps without code. In ten years, we want the majority of apps worldwide to have been built with Glide.\r\n\r\nWe're four technical founders with expertise in native mobile frameworks, developer tools, and product design. We've worked together for 5-10 years, and were all early employees at Xamarin, a mobile developer tools startup acquired by Microsoft in 2016.",

We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",

    "long_description": "Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system 🚛 🌎🌱.\r\n\r\nToday, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. \r\n\r\nWith this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. \r\n\r\nOur product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. \r\n\r\nThe company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).\r\n",

Most of the time, something went painfully wrong.\r\n\r\n60% of the $1.4T global woodworking market is serviced by small businesses with inefficient, manual processes - Cutr is digitising their workflow. This market is massive, chaotic and surprisingly manual. Woodworkers are mostly offline, hard to find and even harder to vet. They need help with critical back-of-house jobs like quoting and capacity planning. Customers have no idea where to find them and need help asking the right questions & providing the right info to get their job produced correctly. \r\n\r\nCutr solves discovery, pricing, payments and workflow for the woodworking market. \r\n\r\nOur users simply upload a file, accept an instant quote, and get their parts delivered. To make that possible we do the heavy lifting: filechecks, automated quoting, matchmaking, creating job packages, tracking changes & updates, logistics and payments.\r\n\r\nCutr saves time, cuts costs and ensures quality with a smooth workflow.\r\n",

We did this by making it exceptionally simple to write tests (low code), simulating end-user workflows accurately, re-using API tests as performance tests, parallel execution, and collaboration via Git. \r\nStaying true to Karate’s “LOCAL-FIRST” approach (user data remains within the customer's firewall, ensuring security and addressing any concerns), we launched the official Karate plugins (IntelliJ and VS Code) for frictionless onboarding, simplified installations, configuration, and maintenance. Our plugins include all Karate open-source features, including exploring of APIs, and premium features (testing for Async APIs, API documentation, API data importer and more).",

As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\r\n\r\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \r\n\r\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.\r\n",

No cloud signup required — works locally by default.\r\n\r\nVibeKit lets developers swap models behind any agent CLI, see exactly what agents do (not just text output), and run agents without affecting their local environment. Teams use it to meet compliance requirements while giving developers the tools they actually want to use.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://www.vibekit.sh/",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

Events come with inherent complexity—they encode something happening rather than something being (i.e., state).\r\n\r\nOur approach is based on replication, where state is transferred directly instead of requiring a back-and-forth conversion to events. We provide primitives to enable teams to break data silos, while keeping in mind data ownership and provenance. Teams define what data their backend publishes and requires, and we'll make sure everything is reactively up-to-date. ReJot works on top of existing infrastructure such as Postgres.\r\n",

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

Our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He later bootstrapped a consumer AI startup to 50k in ARR.\r\n\r\nCyberdesk is already automating tasks that have been typically handled by business process outsourcing teams (BPO) teams, and we're doing so for 20% of the price. The BPO market is a $300B market, which represents a $60B opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you for a demo!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

    "long_description": "Floot lets non-coders & entrepreneurs build real web apps that actually work. We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI. Since June, 3000+ users have created over 4000 apps on Floot.\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With backgrounds in both enterprise engineering (Rheinmetall, dSPACE) and building web apps used by thousands, we have the unique blend of discipline and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to empower anyone to create well-designed applications, regardless of their technical skill. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built. stagewise will enable non-technical stakeholders - product managers, designers, and marketers - to directly iterate on the UI themselves, creating a new, collaborative workflow and making us the essential tool for building on the web.",
