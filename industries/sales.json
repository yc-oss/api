Not only are there fewer headaches for sales reps and their technical counterparts, but sales, presales, and revenue operations leaders have more insight into where and how resources are being used as well as how effective they are at surpassing their goals.\r\n\r\nPrelay enables your revenue team and its internal stakeholders to coordinate and communicate effectively so you can drive more revenue faster as a team.\r\n\r\nPrelay is also backed by top-tier investors including funds like Y Combinator, SV Angel, Liquid2 Ventures and executives from Box, Dropbox, Palantir, SAP, and Microsoft.",
