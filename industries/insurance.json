More than 70% of the 2.5 billion people living at the “base of the pyramid” throughout the world rely on agriculture for income and sustenance. Farmers face a number of major risks to their livelihoods which they cannot control. Insurance gives them a sense of security even if they have a bad harvest, allowing them to improve their diets, invest in their farms, and send their children to school.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly interconnected world, diversified markets are becoming harder and harder to find. WorldCover's investment products offer both retail and professional investors attractive yet uncorrelated returns with the world's financial markets.",

Instead of chasing email threads and re-keying data, Panta’s clients get results 10x faster because our AI agents automate the entire back-office.\r\n\r\nVincent was a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, where he led research on foundation models for recommendation at Vertex AI. Frank was a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Apple and is a top open-source contributor to the Rust and Gleam ecosystems.\r\n\r\nWe realized that while carrier response times are slow, the real bottleneck is the broker. Traditional firms spend 80% of their time on manual data entry, forcing them to scale linearly with headcount. By replacing this work with autonomous agents, we operate with zero data entry and significantly higher margins. We are building a service business with software economics.\r\n\r\nWe formed the company in December and have already bound multiple commercial policies for clients in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe aren't just building a better brokerage; we are building the autonomous infrastructure that American business runs on.",
