This has given a new group of people the power to tell stories and present themselves on their own terms online while also protecting their IRL identities.  Our goal is to build the largest platform tools for this new movement. We're now  the #1 US VTubing app on iOS. \r\n\r\nWe also recently announced our seed funding: we're backed by Amazon, Two Sigma Ventures, MakersFund, YCombinator, and other great investors.\r\n\r\nApp Store: https://hyper.online/download\r\nTechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/hyper-raises-3-6m-from-amazon-and-more-for-its-iphone-based-vtuber-friendly-avatar-platform/",

Both fashion creators and other users can easily style outfits on different models.\r\n\r\nWith our core tech, we are building an active community of fashion creators (designers, stylists, influencers, bloggers, artists, casting directors, etc..) who produce original designs and engaging content around the published pieces. The social media platform will provide a streamlined path for fashion creators to experiment with their ideas and build traction. \r\n\r\nWe want to eventually become the default choice for anyone who wants to launch their fashion label, and have the future Off-White, Balenciaga, Rick Oven, etc. originate from Reverie. Our team combines deep expertise in technology (AI Phds) and the fashion industry (Community builder). Our Virtual Dressing room is live with top retailers (such as Neiman Marcus) and has ~1M ARR. We are backed by YCombinator, TSVC, Cabra VC, and other amazing angels with retail experience and connections. Join us to reshape the fashion industry!",
