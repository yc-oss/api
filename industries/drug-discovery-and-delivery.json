This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",

To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases.

    "long_description": "Reticular helps pharma companies discover drugs with AI models like AlphaFold by making them steerable, just like you can prompt LLMs. Today, limited validation data means companies spend millions on failed experiments trying to steer these models through trial and error. We’re piloting our AI interpretability technology with early-stage biotechs and scaling rapidly. Just a week after our pivot, we identified the first interpretable features ever found in protein models, allowing precise control over biological functions.\r\n\r\nNithin and John met competing in Biology Olympiads before spending 4 years as roommates at MIT publishing ML/bio research in NeurIPS and Nature. We believe biological models encode far more information than anyone is currently using - our goal is to unlock this potential.",

He has an extensive network of hundreds of chemists across Europe.\r\nWe are publishing a groundbreaking paper in Nature demonstrating our AI's ability to optimally plan chemical recipes. We run paid pilots with big pharma companies showing that our platform planned a set of experiments that achieved full conversion in a single attempt, eliminating the usual 8-12 iteration cycle.",
