We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\r\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\r\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\r\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\r\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\r\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\r\nOur Products:\r\n\r\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\r\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

But browsers weren't built for teams 😔. \r\n\r\nThis leads to a bunch of problems like:\r\n- Knowledge/info that is hard to find (links that get lost, documentation that gets, buried, silos, etc)\r\n- Poor collaboration\r\n- Inefficient workflows\r\n\r\nLinkGrep is an AI browser copilot that solves those problems by making your browser team friendly.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we help teams:\r\n1. 🔗 Keep track of links, documents, and more automatically. With LinkGrep you'll never have to manually add or save a link.\r\n2. 🔍 Find information that matters. LinkGrep connects with your existing tools like Notion and Slack and will automatically suggest relevant information to you as your browse (we have semantic search that you can fallback on). Demo: https://youtu.be/jwcPGDRy4oQ\r\n3. 👥 Collaborate better. LinkGrep lets you leave notes and comments directly on web pages — you won't ever have to copy paste a link into Slack ever again. \r\n4. 🤖 Automate team actions like opening up the right links before a meeting. Never disrupt a meeting to send a link again. Demo: https://youtu.be/an3VKpAWft0",

They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\r\n• Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\r\n• Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\r\n• All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\r\n• Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\r\n• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\r\n• And more...\r\n\r\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

Their AI agents, custom scrapers, and integrations pack the power of browser use and automation for search, at a cost that allows for scale. \r\n\r\nMost teams still spend hours (or hire UpWorkers/contractors) to manually copy product specs, check competitor pricing, pull custom KYB/KYC data to assess customer risk, or scrape filings. \r\n\r\nPerplexity and ChatGPT are great for single questions, but they can’t handle large amounts of data at once. And they’re working with a single agent and context window instead of one in every cell.\r\n\r\nAnd Riveter’s web browsing can go further—even reading PDFs and images that may contain answers. \r\n\r\nWith Riveter, anyone can automate complex, auditable web research… without coding. \r\n\r\nOur founding team brings deep product and engineering expertise from to YC-backed companies Gusto, Retool, and Middesk.",

As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

    "long_description": "Logical is a desktop AI that acts as a proactive and largely promptless copilot, designed to reduce the friction of using AI for everyday tasks. It transfers context across apps, and allows taking action on many apps with just a few clicks. Logical can assist with drafting emails, writing docs, noting meetings and can even automatically detect action items. Need to prompt? Logical can understand intent in much fewer words than a regular chatbot. Plus, user data is never sent to Logical servers. Logical is the AI resurrection of Clippy, but actually good.",

Simply describe your process via video call or share documentation, and our forward-deployed engineering team ensures it's automated exactly your way.\r\nOur AI agents work 24/7 and can be kicked-off via email, Slack, or our web app, handling tasks like CRM updates, report generation, and data entry while adapting to your existing software.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus:\r\nWe're starting with recruiting and executive search firms, automating candidate codification, assessment reports, and administrative workflows that typically consume hours of manual work each day.\r\n\r\nValue Proposition:\r\nOur pricing is 100% outcome based: you only pay for the work outputs we complete (e.g., candidates added to CRM, reports generate, etc.). Current customers are already live and saving an average of 60% in costs compared to human workers, with full automation deployed within one week.",
