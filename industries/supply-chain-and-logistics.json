    "long_description": "Why did we pick this idea to work on? \r\nIndia is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally \"bringing the gas stations to doorsteps\". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.\r\n\r\nDo we have domain expertise in this area? \r\nFounder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.\r\n\r\nHow do you know people need what you're making? \r\nWe have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand.",

We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n🤕 The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\n✅ Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

Every year 50% of U.S. truck space goes unused, a $100B+ inefficiency. Oway uses AI to automatically price, match, and sell that space in real time, giving businesses freight shipping that is dramatically faster and cheaper than traditional options. \r\n\r\nWe're building the largest decentralized network of America’s empty truck space - a transparent infrastructure layer any shipper, broker, or carrier can plug into. For shippers, this means freight costs that are up to 50% lower than traditional LTL (shipments from 1 to 12 pallets), along with faster delivery windows because freight moves directly from dock to dock without the slow handoffs, warehouses, or cross-docking infrastructure that LTL depends on. For carriers, Oway’s integration can increase annual revenues by up to 30% with minimal impact on existing schedules. They simply earn more by monetizing space that would have gone unused.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to transform empty truck space into an asset that strengthens U.S. competitiveness. By lowering the cost of goods sold, we help businesses grow. By improving carrier margins, we make trucking more sustainable. And by digitizing and decentralizing freight, we are laying the foundation for a resilient, transparent logistics layer that can support America’s reindustrialization in the decades ahead. Oway makes freight shipping as simple as ridesharing - click a button, book a truck, and move goods at the true cost of available capacity.",

And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "long_description": "Fleetline is building the first complete-context algorithmic load planner for mid to large-sized trucking fleets. Today’s dispatchers face an overwhelming task: balancing regulations, customer demands, live fleet data, and individual driver needs, all while coordinating across siloed tools and teams. Mistakes run rampant, and each mistake is thousands of dollars. Even the select fleets using algorithms that have fleet-wide context struggle: the outputs are rigid, hard to interpret, and are blind to real-world nuances like driver preferences and schedule exceptions. Fleetline solves this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can easily adapt algorithms to each fleet’s needs and capture driver-specific information. The result is smarter planning truly optimized for every fleet and its drivers.",

Everyone knows these are necessary evils that essentially run the business but take up a lot of operational capacity. They are not about to just rip and replace their existing system that runs their whole business with a system that takes years to implement. Imagine if they could implement AI that runs the ERP for them, in weeks?\r\n\r\nBurnt’s building an agentic OS for the Food Supply Chain with AI Agents for each department. \r\n\r\nOur AI Agent, Ozai, has started by replacing the whole order management job function at food distribution companies, so that sales and customer service teams can focus on what matters - the customer. Ozai monitors all incoming messages (emails, phone calls, voicemails, whatsapp, fax etc.), figures out if it's an order, learns each customer's habits, shorthand, and favorite products, picks up on any prep notes, and enters it straight into the existing ERP. It'll even go back to the customers on your behalf when it's not sure about something, clarify things and carry on working. \r\n\r\nThe more it sees, the smarter it gets. \r\n",
