Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",

Our platform integrates directly into existing university systems (SIS, LMS, CRM), learns each institution’s unique workflows, and deploys specialized AI agents. This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.\r\n\r\nSadia previously built Salesforce’s Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.\r\n\r\nDanial was one of DoorDash’s earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale. \r\n\r\nShahryar was a GM at Airwallex, where he built the entire Americas business from 0 to 1 and drove 11x revenue growth.  He’s also a master closer, single-handedly securing over $17M in enterprise deals at NerdWallet.  He’s a relentless startup executor with deep expertise launching and scaling go-to-market machines in highly regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe launched six weeks ago and are already at $8k MRR, growing 55% week-over-week -- one of the fastest ramps ever in higher ed. Universities urgently need solutions that expand labor capacity and efficiency, especially as they face unprecedented budget pressure and staffing shortages.\r\n\r\nWith unmatched buyer access, deep technical expertise, and rapid early traction, we are perfectly positioned to own this enormous market.",
