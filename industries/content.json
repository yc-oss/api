These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town.\n\nThe gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a \"mob\", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.",

    "long_description": "The artist-formerly-known-as Scoopler is a real-time search engine. It aggregates and organizes content being shared on the Internet as it happens, like eye-witness reports of breaking news, photos and videos from big events, and links to the hottest memes of the day. It does this by constantly indexing live updates from services including Twitter, Flickr, Digg, Delicious and more. When users search for a topic on Scoopler, they get the most relevant results, updated in real-time.\n\nScoopler has now become JustSpotted, a celebrity-tracking tool, meant to give fans an idea of what their favorite celebrities are up to at any given moment. JustSpotted, like Scoopler, is a data-aggregator, yet JustSpotted collects from Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare -- alongside their own data theyâ€™ll be collecting from users who actual spot celebrities in the wild. All the information we aggregate is publicly available and you can even do a search on Twitter yourself and find sightings of celebrities. We're just the first people to organize it on a map and in such a way that it's easy to consume and ENJOY.â€\n\nJustSpotted is about connecting with celebs. All the sightings on our website are naturally occurring events where an everyday person bumps into a celebrity as a chance occurrence. Back in the day, when you saw a celebrity while you were out and about the first thing you would have done was phone or text a friend. In the new age of social media, the first thing you do is share it on Facebook or Twitter. This phenomena is already happening.\n\nThe service, which launches the week of October 11, 2010, is the latest creation by AJ Asver, Dilan Jarawardane and Benjamin Tauber.",

Pixley gives them safe and personalized stories that encourage learning and imagination.\r\n\r\nBut kids’ cartoons are just the beginning. As video generation improves, all video content will shift from manual production to being personalized and generated. Our long-term goal is to build the AI Netflix: a platform where shows and movies aren’t recommended, but instead generated around each viewer’s interests and habits.\r\n\r\nWe’re 19 year old CS dropouts who’ve known each other since elementary school and won 4 hackathons at 15. After seeing AI flood the internet with low-quality content, we created Pixley – a safe, personalized way for kids to turn their ideas into animated stories.",
