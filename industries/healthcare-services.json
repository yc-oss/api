Through a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform, our service connects users with a carefully curated team of wellness professionals. By conducting online consultations via video chat, written journals, and even texting sessions, we have transformed traditional therapy into an experience that is low-cost, convenient, and completely confidential.\n\nEveryone can benefit from an objective perspective during difficult times, but the current model for supportive services is broken due to insurance gridlock, a clunky referral system, long wait times and unsustainable costs. Our web-based approach offers valuable guidance through accessible and anonymous means. Users log in to secure accounts and speak with licensed professionals on a variety of topics—relationship conflict, job stress, etc.—from anywhere at any time. With our proprietary technology, we have removed every barrier to entry and created an outlet for millions who wouldn’t have sought emotional health services otherwise, reducing stress for an increasingly stressed-out generation. This is the future of mental health. \n\nThe shift in moving counseling services online is inevitable and our product is already in demand: After a successful pilot with Pretty Padded Room, an online therapy website specifically targeted towards millennial women, we are excited to relaunch as In Your Corner, an aspirational brand that provides the very best in counseling, coaching, and calm. In Your Corner improves on our original offering by being more gender-inclusive and convenient. In addition to developing a mobile app to provide one-tap, on-demand support in real time, users also have access not only to licensed mental health counselors, but also coaches in personal and professional development as well as instructors of meditation and breath work.",

The web-based platform accelerates information exchange among medical scientists and research pathologists. HistoWiz's mission is to fight cancer cooperatively instead of individually by connecting scientists and pathologists for online collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe HistoWiz advantage\r\nWe help your lab minimize the cost of research and maximize research productivity by providing the most efficient service for scientists to analyze experimental pathology specimens. We believe that scientists should spend their time on results interpretation rather than repetitive tissue cutting.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nHistoWiz accepts formalin-fixed specimens by mail for tissue processing services. To expedite delivery of results and to facilitate global collaboration, HistoWiz offers whole-slide imaging and pathology services, allowing researchers to remotely and instantly view high-magnification images of their specimens via a secure, cloud-based “virtual microscope” on any computer or mobile device without downloading any software or gigabyte-sized files.",

Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost. PNOĒ has been independently validated by Georgetown University, VA in Maryland, and Rutgers University and is trusted by leading institutions including Cenegenics, Dais Cove, MIT, UCLA, Pan Pacific, CLMBR, UCS, OURA, TONAL, Spartan Racing, and Paris Saint Germain.
