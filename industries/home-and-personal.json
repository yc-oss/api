The problem is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally, we started Lawdingo to answer just that. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a lawyer, we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more effective way to grow your law practice. \r\n\r\nWe also encourage you not to take our word for it.

Through thoughtful reinvention of everyday interactions, we empower people everywhere to collectively make a greater impact with their most basic daily rituals. \r\n\r\nWe started with the shower. \r\n\r\nThe Nebia shower embodies the highest standards of experience, design, engineering and water and energy use. With water savings up to 70% compared to traditional showers, Nebia was designed to make a meaningful impact without compromising on experience.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our products is our unwavering dedication to developing groundbreaking sustainable solutions that stand the test of time. Every new iteration is made to solve a complex engineering challenge that has limited innovation for over a century. Our investment in R&D and product development is second only to our investment in the people who are making it possible.\r\n\r\nAfter several years working behind the scenes, we are extremely proud of what we have recently achieved:\r\n- $10m raised on Kickstarter\r\n- Products in 100,000 homes\r\n- 500+ million gallons of water saved (c. 2022)\r\n- 27 million kWh (27 GWh) of energy (approx. energy to heat 2,700 U.S. homes in one year)",

Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use.

By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.\r\n",
