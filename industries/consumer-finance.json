Coin 2.0 lets you swipe or tap your cards at millions of merchants across the USA. Coin 2.0 has 80%+ compatibility, partly because we use cutting-edge technology that has not yet been integrated into all point-of-sale systems. We encourage customers to carry a “backup card” given the wide variety of sales registers in the USA. While Coin 2.0 shares the same form factor as a credit card, it features enhancements such as an electronic display and a single button to allow for simple switching between different cards. With over-the-air updates, Coin 2.0 adapts to evolving payment technology, offering future-ready ubiquity in a small and powerful package. Coin's security features also keep your information safe. Auto-unlock means that only you can use your Coin 2.0 while Last Known Location helps you find your Coin 2.0 in case of loss or theft. Coin 2.0 is designed for use in the USA.

Every time a user make any digital transaction, we round off the amount to the nearest 10 INR and invest it for them into a diversified portfolio, automatically.\r\n\r\n400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.\r\n\r\nWe're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.\r\n\r\nPotentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. \r\n\r\nMore interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to become a one-stop asset management solution for millennials.",

Plus, each Sequin Card is customized with a money mantra!\r\n\r\nVrinda Gupta, the founder and CEO, launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve at Visa, where she was rejected from the credit card she built! She learned that 70% of women today were making avoidable financial mistakes like she was, and embarked on a mission to close gender-based financial gaps. She teamed up with ex-PayPal engineering leader, Mark Thomas, co-founder and CTO, to build a membership-based banking designed to empower women financially.\r\n\r\nSequin is backed by high-profile investors such as the Schwab Family, Y Combinator, and IDEO Ventures and is an official Visa partner. The team plans to expand its offerings into a $65B largely untapped market for women's financial products from first bank account to retirement products. ",
