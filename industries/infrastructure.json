This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

PipelineDB should be used for analytics use cases that only require summary data, like realtime reporting dashboards. PipelineDB is not a good fit for exploratory analytics on siloed datasets.\r\n",

At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\r\n\r\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\r\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\r\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\r\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\r\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\r\n\r\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.\r\n",

Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. \r\n\r\nOur CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.\r\n\r\nOur video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",

How cool is that?\r\n\r\nGitHub loves us - we're one of the fastest-growing libraries there, and we're used by little-known companies like Google, Waymo, and Intel. No big deal. \r\n\r\nOur founding team hails from places like Princeton, Stanford, Google, and Tesla, and we're backed by Y Combinator & other Silicon Valley heavyweights. \r\n\r\nActiveloop is hiring, and we want you!

But today’s data platforms (like Databricks and Snowflake) are built on top of tools made for spreadsheet-like analytics, not the petabytes of multimodal data that power AI. As a result, teams waste months on brittle infrastructure instead of conducting research and building their core product.\r\n\r\nEventual was founded in 2022 to solve this. Our mission is to make querying any kind of data, images, video, audio, text, as intuitive as working with tables, and powerful enough to scale to production workloads. Our open-source engine, Daft, is purpose-built for real-world AI systems: coordinating with external APIs, managing GPU clusters, and handling failures that traditional engines can’t. Daft already powers critical workloads at companies like Amazon, Mobileye, Together AI, and CloudKitchens.\r\n\r\nWe’ve assembled a world-class team from Databricks, AWS, Nvidia, Pinecone, GitHub Copilot, Tesla, and more, quadrupling our size within a year. With backing from Y Combinator, Caffeinated Capital, Array.vc, and top angels from the co-founders of Databricks and Perplexity, we’re looking to double the team now. Join us—Eventual is just getting started.\r\n\r\nPlease note we are looking for someone who is willing and able to come into our San Francisco office in the Mission district 4 days / week.",

Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives.

We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.
