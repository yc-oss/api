We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

Despite $100 billion being spent annually on weed control, weeds still cost the US economy $46B/year. Weeds steal sunlight and nutrients from crops, forcing farmers to choose between higher costs and lower yields. Moreover, many farms still rely on hand labor to control weed growth. The process is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult due to constant labor shortages (1 out of every 5 US farm positions go unfilled each year). Our robot nicknamed the Field Hand is able to automate one of the worst jobs on a farm and will help healthily feed the world. ",
