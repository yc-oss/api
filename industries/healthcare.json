Bill Gates recognized Experiment by saying \"this solution helps close the gap for potentially-promising but unfunded projects.\"",

We provide access to protein engineering, DNA assembly, transient experiments and stable transformation as a service. The best thing is that anything \"Powered by TAXA\" is designed to be free from expensive regulatory approval, meaning the products are available for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States immediately after they are developed. For a detailed list of the experiments which can be run on our platform please see the Services page.\r\n\r\nOur vision is a world where bio-engineering is as easy and commonplace as mobile application development is today. Game-changing technologies, like genetic engineering, should not be the exclusive preserve of large corporations and a wealthy elite. Democratizing the tools of creation enables anyone, anywhere, to genetically engineer plants and will unleash a wave of creativity to power an environment where ultimately what we create is limited only by our imagination.  The TAXA platform is our next step in the realization of that dream\r\n\r\nWe are also the team behind the first synthetic biology crowdfunding project, raising $484k on Kickstarter to make real glowing plants: www.glowingplant.com",

Through a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform, our service connects users with a carefully curated team of wellness professionals. By conducting online consultations via video chat, written journals, and even texting sessions, we have transformed traditional therapy into an experience that is low-cost, convenient, and completely confidential.\n\nEveryone can benefit from an objective perspective during difficult times, but the current model for supportive services is broken due to insurance gridlock, a clunky referral system, long wait times and unsustainable costs. Our web-based approach offers valuable guidance through accessible and anonymous means. Users log in to secure accounts and speak with licensed professionals on a variety of topics—relationship conflict, job stress, etc.—from anywhere at any time. With our proprietary technology, we have removed every barrier to entry and created an outlet for millions who wouldn’t have sought emotional health services otherwise, reducing stress for an increasingly stressed-out generation. This is the future of mental health. \n\nThe shift in moving counseling services online is inevitable and our product is already in demand: After a successful pilot with Pretty Padded Room, an online therapy website specifically targeted towards millennial women, we are excited to relaunch as In Your Corner, an aspirational brand that provides the very best in counseling, coaching, and calm. In Your Corner improves on our original offering by being more gender-inclusive and convenient. In addition to developing a mobile app to provide one-tap, on-demand support in real time, users also have access not only to licensed mental health counselors, but also coaches in personal and professional development as well as instructors of meditation and breath work.",

We approach it as a big data learning problem, and bring to bear techniques from machine learning, distributed systems, AI planning, program synthesis, data mining, and natural language processing. With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.\n\nOur current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n’s technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.\n\n[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.\n[2] DARPA in the past supported work that led to the internet, stealth planes, GPS, and even Douglas Engelbart’s mother-of-all-demos.",

And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored.\r\n\r\nQvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.\r\n\r\nOur health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.\r\n\r\nAll of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward.

    "long_description": "Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\r\n\r\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\r\n\r\nOncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\r\n\r\nWe actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. \r\n\r\nOur team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",

    "long_description": "AesculaTech believes in building better lives through smart chemistry. We design custom smart materials for a range of biomedical, commercial, and industrial applications. Our platform technology, AesculaGel offers adaptive response to a wide range of stimuli and can be tailor-made for biocompatibility, material strength, and a range of other attributes. \r\n\r\nFounded by one of MIT's 35 under 35 Innovators, AesculaTech is the shared vision of scientists, engineers, and medical experts. Our cornerstone product, Humidifeye, is an ophthalmic platform to treat dry eye disease. Dry eye affects more than 25 million Americans and the global treatment market is projected higher than $6 Billion within the next decade. Our thermally responsive, form-fitting materials are suitable for sustained yet reversible occlusion across a range of treatment times. In contrast to existing technologies, our product will not extrude, or cause discomfort as it adapts to patients. Though Humidifeye is not yet FDA approved, expect to hear about it soon!\r\n\r\nIn coordination with partners across several sectors, we have a variety of groundbreaking technologies in the works that live up to our vision. This work has already been recognized. AesculaTech was named a Rosenman Innovator, received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, was a finalist in the 2019 Octane High Tech Awards, and is a graduate of both the Y Combinator and TMCx accelerator programs. In short, Y-Combinator was only the beginning. \r\n\r\n",

Our virus-free gene editing platform allows us to engineer a dose of CAR-T cell therapy for ~$500, and brings the promise of a curative outcome. Given our safety and efficacy data to date, we believe this product could be used by general practice veterinarians, meaning we have thousands of customers all across the USA who typically treat with palliative care or refer cancer patients to specialty oncologists. Our CAR-T cell platform is regulated by the USDA, not the FDA, affording us a cost effective \"full stack\" to iterate and innovate on CAR-T cell therapy from a hypothesis through clinical validation.

For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in anti-aging quantification, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical systems, including the heart, lungs, cells, and nervous system. Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost. PNOĒ has been independently validated by Georgetown University, VA in Maryland, and Rutgers University and is trusted by leading institutions including Cenegenics, Dais Cove, MIT, UCLA, Pan Pacific, CLMBR, UCS, OURA, TONAL, Spartan Racing, and Paris Saint Germain.

Traditionally, it has been the women’s financial and health burden to have a contraceptive in place. Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being.",

This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why are we the leader?** \r\n\r\nThe company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:\r\n\r\n1. Nationwide insurance coverage (10M+ lives)\r\n2. Military contracts (Including the Navy SEALs and 15M+ veterans)\r\n3. Employer offerings (Working with the top fertility benefit providers)\r\n\r\n**Tell me about the team** \r\n\r\nWe're a team of about 30, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning. \r\n\r\nLearn more about our values here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/legacys-values-and-why-they-matter-db116539d3da\r\n\r\nLearn more about our workplace here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nRead about our mission to humanize the path to parenthood:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nLearn more about sperm and why it matters here:\r\ndocsend.com/view/zkgk7ws",

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.\r\n\r\nOur small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. \r\n\r\nOur management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.\r\n\r\nOur team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\n",

We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\r\n",

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors.",

We demonstrate a reduction in fibrosis with our drug, but more significantly, we show a reversal in fibrotic tissue back to normal tissue. \r\n\r\nWith our current developmental strategy, we hope to have a clinic-ready compound by the end of 2021 and be in phase I clinical trials by mid of 2022. \r\n",

    "long_description": "Who we are?\r\nWe write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",

We are accelerating the global take-up of GLP-1 medications by increasing their accessibility to help solve obesity worldwide.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\r\n\r\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >40x since Aug 2023. We’re serving >50k customers with high NPS. We’re >$100M/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023.\r\n\r\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started.

The program is delivered remotely over the phone and through the mobile app, therefore users are able to follow the lifestyle program from the convenience of their home. Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.\r\n\r\nThe user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.\r\n\r\nOur unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.\r\n\r\nBreathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot.",

This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.\r\n\r\nFor decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

    "long_description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\r\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\r\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\r\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\r\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\r\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\r\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\r\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.\r\n\r\nWe have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. \r\n\r\nDespite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.\r\n\r\nNick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are.

    "long_description": "In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy—a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.\r\n\r\nOur Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.\r\n\r\nImpact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.\r\n\r\nRecognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company—it’s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.\r\n ",

The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

NICUs are time sensitive wards in the hospital, time is everything and yet nurses today continue to prepare frozen milk for infants in what's known as the milk shift. A shift where the nurse spends the day defrosting milk for the next shift of nurses. Our tech is now fully peer reviewed and published, yielding safe and reliable results in over 20 hospitals in the New York Tri-State. The company is headed by Vansh Langer MD, a physician (Windsor University, University of Chicago) and Blanca Aguilar Uscanga PhD, a Bioengineering/Food Science PhD (University of Guadalajara /Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI)) team that has over 50 published works in the field between them and are experts in the science of infant nutrition. Vansh saw the immense need for a time critical solution in the NICU and helped solve the puzzle with Dra. Blanca and her team and decided to work together to: Nurture the Future.",

It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\r\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",

Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.

Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\r\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.

Aidy excels at identifying patterns between diet, treatment adherence, and symptoms, giving our users a much more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of their condition to supplement clinician care. \r\n\r\nPreviously in our careers, both Max and Peter worked in health in different capacities. At the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Senate, Max worked in public health policy and COVID-19 response, while Peter worked as an ML researcher for a number of biotech companies. After a lengthy “pivot hell” we decided to finally listen to a friend with IBD who insisted that there weren’t any decent apps to help people live with the disease. Pretty quickly, we discovered how LLMs and regular structured questionnaire responses could provide a level of patient empowerment not possible before for chronic diseases. From there, Aidy was (re)born!",

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting. We have published the first molecule water solubility results with accuracy within the error range of wet lab experiments. We have also kicked-off a 150K pilot project with a pharma company to apply our tech to estimating solubility in their drug development pipeline.",

We also connect with over 20 popular wearable devices including Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Dexcom, bringing all your medical records and health data into one unified space. \r\n\r\nWe founded Galen because for over four years, Viraj struggled to navigate several conditions related to chronic low back pain. He often found himself waiting weeks for responses from his care team, received little guidance or education about new diagnoses, and was overwhelmed trying to manage overlapping conditions and medications.\r\n\r\nHis experiences are not unique. Our healthcare system is overloaded and fragmented, and often, patients are left to navigate their care on their own. Everyday there are nearly 1 billion health-related Google searches, but the responses to such queries are generic and impersonalized, because the searches lack any insight into a users personal health background.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging your own data and state-of-the art LLM memory capabilities, Galen delivers personalized insights, proactive health recommendations, and 24/7 on-demand medical support — empowering patients to be an active part of their health team. We are a consumer app in beta testing and will be available on the App Store soon!",

Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\r\n\r\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:\r\n• Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n• Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n• Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued. We catch nuanced billing, coding, and contract errors to save 3-7% on annual claims spend. We work with self-insured employers and health plans.\r\n\r\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐔𝐬:\r\nAngel Onuoha (CEO) and Ahmad Shehu (CTO) have worked together for 4 years. Before Avelis Health they built Zuvy, a Lagos-based fintech company that provided invoice factoring to small businesses. Zuvy was acquired by The BAS Group in 2025.",

Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",

    "long_description": "Prana replaces the reactive, 15-minute annual physical with continuous, proactive care. We connect to your medical records and wearables to watch for \"clinical drift,\" catching subtle declines in health that human doctors miss between visits.\r\n\r\nMost AI health apps are just chatbots. Prana is a full-stack medical provider. Our AI acts as a always-on physician that watches your data, explains your labs, and manages your prescriptions.\r\n\r\nSafety & Scale: We automate 90% of the \"grunt work\" (history taking, logistics, triage) so our human doctors can focus purely on high-leverage decisions. This allows us to offer <60 minute access to a physician, 24/7, for a fraction of the cost of traditional care.\r\n\r\nThe Team:\r\n - Meer Patel (CEO): JHU BME. Deferred Brown Medical School to build Prana because code scales better than appointments.\r\n- Vishvam Rawal (CTO): Ex-Quant. Building high-frequency data infrastructure for health signals.\r\n- Sanjit Menon (CHO): Graduating MD Candidate. Deep clinical expertise to ensure our models practice good medicine.\r\n\r\nTraction: Live in beta with early users.",

    "long_description": "Ritivel turns raw clinical trial data into FDA submission documents in minutes. Traditionally, medical writers spend 8-12 weeks manually compiling data; our system uses study protocol and statistical outputs to instantly generate these reports with full traceability to the source data.\r\n\r\nClinical development is pharma's biggest bottleneck. Despite rising R&D, trial timelines have increased 33% over the last decade. Accelerating clinical timelines by 20% unlocks hundreds of millions in additional revenue per drug by extending patent life. \r\n\r\nGeneric AI fails in pharma due to a lack of traceability, with only 28% of pilots reaching production - the FDA requires traceability for all claims. Our proprietary engine solves this with word-level traceability, linking every generated sentence to clinical evidence. We deploy 100% on-premise to keep sensitive patient data within the client's infrastructure, making us a trusted AI partner for pharma.\r\n\r\nWe automate the most complex parts of CSRs (clinical narratives and biostatistical analysis). Our high-quality output, validated by senior regulatory writers, costs 1/100th of human writing. We're built by experts from Microsoft, Kearney, and IQVIA - combining deep AI engineering with regulatory expertise to solve the \"last mile\" of drug development—a problem generic AI wrappers can't solve because they don't understand the standards or FDA requirements.",
