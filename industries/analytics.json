As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.

As these excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance companies that invest into oil & gas can’t mitigate against incoming risks from new regulations, \r\n\r\nWe have built a technology that can for the first time use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation. In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://orbio.earth",
