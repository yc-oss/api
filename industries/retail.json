One of the biggest challenges we see is staffing — many retailers struggle to maintain consistent, reliable, and properly trained team members to handle back-office tasks, marketing, ecommerce, POS management, and basic tech know-how.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we offer affordable, ecommerce expertise as a service. Retailers no longer have to worry about high turnover, constant retraining, or trying to learn everything themselves. Instead, they can stay focused on what they love: curating great products and delivering an amazing in-store experience — while we handle the rest. And since it’s a simple expense, it’s easy to plan for and write off, too.",

A % of these fees are always invalid and brands have to go through a lengthy process to get back money owed to them.

Zoko solves this by seamlessly integrating WhatsApp commerce capabilities with your existing Shopify infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTHE UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY THAT'S COSTING YOU SALES\r\nConsider this: 175 million people message businesses on WhatsApp daily - that's more engagement than Amazon generates.

Starting with their own ecommerce business entirely on WhatsApp, they scaled to 200,000 engaged followers who eagerly purchased products through weekly WhatsApp updates. When other businesses began paying for access to their \"WhatsApp sales tools,\" they knew they'd discovered something revolutionary.\r\n\r\nTHE $50 BILLION MARKET OPPORTUNITY\r\nThe WhatsApp commerce market represents over $50 billion annually - a massive revenue stream that traditional ecommerce platforms can't access. For Shopify merchants, this means untapped customers, higher engagement rates, and sales happening through the world's most trusted messaging platform.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE SALES, MARKETING & SUPPORT INTEGRATION\r\nZoko transforms WhatsApp into a comprehensive business channel, enabling Shopify merchants to:\r\n- Convert conversations directly into sales\r\n- Run targeted marketing campaigns through WhatsApp\r\n- Provide instant customer support where customers prefer to communicate\r\n- Build deeper customer relationships through personalized messaging\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF COMMERCE IS CONVERSATIONAL\r\nWhatsApp represents the internet for the next billion users entering the digital economy. Zoko positions itself as the \"Shopify for WhatsApp merchants,\" giving existing Shopify store owners the tools to dominate this emerging channel before competitors realize its potential.\r\n\r\nFor Shopify merchants serious about growth, Zoko isn't just another tool - it's the bridge to the next generation of ecommerce where conversations convert to sales.",

    "long_description": "E-commerce brands rely on disconnected, outdated systems to manage everything after the buy button. From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",
