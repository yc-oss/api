One of the biggest challenges we see is staffing — many retailers struggle to maintain consistent, reliable, and properly trained team members to handle back-office tasks, marketing, ecommerce, POS management, and basic tech know-how.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we offer affordable, ecommerce expertise as a service. Retailers no longer have to worry about high turnover, constant retraining, or trying to learn everything themselves. Instead, they can stay focused on what they love: curating great products and delivering an amazing in-store experience — while we handle the rest. And since it’s a simple expense, it’s easy to plan for and write off, too.",

Zoko solves this by seamlessly integrating WhatsApp commerce capabilities with your existing Shopify infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTHE UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY THAT'S COSTING YOU SALES\r\nConsider this: 175 million people message businesses on WhatsApp daily - that's more engagement than Amazon generates.

Starting with their own ecommerce business entirely on WhatsApp, they scaled to 200,000 engaged followers who eagerly purchased products through weekly WhatsApp updates. When other businesses began paying for access to their \"WhatsApp sales tools,\" they knew they'd discovered something revolutionary.\r\n\r\nTHE $50 BILLION MARKET OPPORTUNITY\r\nThe WhatsApp commerce market represents over $50 billion annually - a massive revenue stream that traditional ecommerce platforms can't access. For Shopify merchants, this means untapped customers, higher engagement rates, and sales happening through the world's most trusted messaging platform.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE SALES, MARKETING & SUPPORT INTEGRATION\r\nZoko transforms WhatsApp into a comprehensive business channel, enabling Shopify merchants to:\r\n- Convert conversations directly into sales\r\n- Run targeted marketing campaigns through WhatsApp\r\n- Provide instant customer support where customers prefer to communicate\r\n- Build deeper customer relationships through personalized messaging\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF COMMERCE IS CONVERSATIONAL\r\nWhatsApp represents the internet for the next billion users entering the digital economy. Zoko positions itself as the \"Shopify for WhatsApp merchants,\" giving existing Shopify store owners the tools to dominate this emerging channel before competitors realize its potential.\r\n\r\nFor Shopify merchants serious about growth, Zoko isn't just another tool - it's the bridge to the next generation of ecommerce where conversations convert to sales.",

After an order is placed, teams still spend their days tracking shipments, chasing exceptions, processing returns, adjusting invoices, and answering “Can you check this?” requests. This manual busywork lives outside core systems and scales linearly with order volume, forcing brands and 3PLs to keep adding headcount as they scale.\r\n\r\nHandled is an operations automation platform for e-commerce brands and the 3PLs that run their order fulfillment. We execute the manual work that happens after an order is placed by unifying post-order data across commerce, warehouse, carrier, and support systems.\r\nHandled gives teams real-time visibility across orders, shipments, returns, and inventory in one system — eliminating the need to dig through disconnected tools or react only after customers complain. When issues occur, Handled automatically executes the follow-up work, such as resolving shipment delays, processing returns, filing claims, or making order and billing adjustments, without manual back-and-forth.\r\n\r\nBy combining visibility, issue detection, and automated execution in a single AI-powered operational layer, Handled replaces manual coordination with software-driven post-order operations in a large, recurring market tied directly to e-commerce volume.",
