As a Product team at Revolut, we felt this pain deeply ourselves - we had products ready to launch but stuck in compliance limbo, often for weeks. Turns out, getting compliant took as long as building the product itself. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, we dug in and were shocked by how manual and inefficient the processes were. That’s when it clicked: there’s a huge opportunity to automate the boring stuff (and solve our own problem!). Compliance teams win because they ditch the tedious tasks.
