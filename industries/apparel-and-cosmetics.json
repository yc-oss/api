By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.\r\n\r\nTang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",

Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. \r\n\r\nAdvantages to our P2P model\r\n\r\n- Entrepreneur-led\r\n    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters”\r\n- More variety in inventory\r\n    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet\r\n- Better margins\r\n    - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items\r\n    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition\r\n\r\nHere are some of our links!\r\n\r\n[dressd website](https://dressd.com/stylist-waitlist)\r\n\r\n[dressd instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shop.dressd/)\r\n\r\n[dressd tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdMPYFRY/)\r\n\r\nread about dressd in Yahoo!
