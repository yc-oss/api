With sequencing and synthesis being mainstream now [1], 20n provides the computational systems that predict DNA design for novel industrial biotech and health applications.\n\nAt 20n, we are taking a fresh look at turning biological data into information. We approach it as a big data learning problem, and bring to bear techniques from machine learning, distributed systems, AI planning, program synthesis, data mining, and natural language processing. With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.\n\nOur current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n’s technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.\n\n[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.\n[2] DARPA in the past supported work that led to the internet, stealth planes, GPS, and even Douglas Engelbart’s mother-of-all-demos.",

We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\r\n",

Specifically, we have harnessed the power of one of Nature's smallest but most powerful technologies: enzymes. Enzymes are everywhere. They break down the food in your stomach, remove dirt from your clothes, and make our beer. At BluumBio, we look for enzymes found in bacteria, algae, plants and other living organisms that naturally degrade toxic chemicals.
