In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\r\n\r\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",

They want to provide everyone with a never ending stream of transformative experiences, but doing that is going to require us to change the space around games. Players need to be able to find the experiences that feel made for them, and the community around those games has to be welcoming and inclusive. Independent developers, meanwhile, need a way to improve discoverability, extend their revenue stream and find a space in which content is rewarded based on quality, not marketing budget.\n\nThey are working to fix every one of those problems. They have built a discovery system that’s going to help you find games you truly love. Our community is a work in progress, but you can learn more on our blog. And our library is going to keep growing, so that when you finish one great game, you’ll find another that you’d swear was made with you in mind.",
