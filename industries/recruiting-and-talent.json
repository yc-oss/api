    "long_description": "At Ashby, we're improving the productivity of working professionals with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\r\n\r\nOur first products provide talent teams with clever automation, powerful analytics tools, and customizable workflows packaged in great UX. We have many paying customers who love us and use us every day like Opendoor, Airtable, Duolingo, and Notion. Notion's Head of Talent said Ashby is \"probably the tool we are in the most and rely on the most, as a recruiting team.\"\r\n\r\nOur culture is motivated by Abhik's (my co-founder and Head of Engineering) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build a great product and service fast (and work regular hours!). We hire exceptional, kind, thoughtful people and provide an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.\r\n\r\nWe are well funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. We'll share more once we meet!",

We get to personally know the top tech leaders who are interested in joining product teams in the US for the long-term. These individuals are not actively seeking jobs through freelancer platforms.\r\n\r\n98% retention: Developer churn slows teams down. That’s why, when you hire with Howdy, developers are automatically provided with premium health insurance, top-of-the-line Apple equipment, gym memberships, lunches and the use of class-A office spaces.\r\nYour engineering culture: When you partner with Howdy, you're not just hiring individuals; you're gaining access to a skilled local workforce that becomes an extension of your team.

After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",
