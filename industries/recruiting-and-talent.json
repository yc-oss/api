We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\r\n\r\nOur first products provide talent teams with clever automation, powerful analytics tools, and customizable workflows packaged in great UX. We have many paying customers who love us and use us every day like Opendoor, Airtable, Duolingo, and Notion. Notion's Head of Talent said Ashby is \"probably the tool we are in the most and rely on the most, as a recruiting team.\"\r\n\r\nOur culture is motivated by Abhik's (my co-founder and Head of Engineering) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build a great product and service fast (and work regular hours!). We hire exceptional, kind, thoughtful people and provide an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.\r\n\r\nWe are well funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom.

After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

    "long_description": "When it comes to hiring, there are lots of resources to help managers get more candidates. But on average, only 1 in every 300 of these candidates actually get hired. Hiring managers and recruiters end up taking a robotic, brute force approach to sourcing - the kind of approach top talent hates.\r\n\r\nManagers are increasingly finding that the simplest and most personable way to attract talent starts with their network. The best candidates want to work for great people, not faceless companies. Sharing open roles on places like LinkedIn, Slack, and Twitter unlocks enormous potential for a personalized recruiting approach across a curated talent pool, but these referrals are difficult to track across platforms and end up lost in the shuffle. We are changing that.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade building teams at high-growth consumer tech companies like Instacart, Snapchat, and Uber, Maddy Nguyen turned her attention to creating collaborative tools for hiring managers and recruiters to source candidates from a wider range of networks and communities - while staying human.",
