We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.\r\n\r\nBattling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database.

Our work has been featured in The New York Times, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Fast Company, and many more.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Impactive will expand its platform further into nonprofit, advocacy, and additional markets.

Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.\r\n\r\nWe’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable.

In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed.

Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years.
