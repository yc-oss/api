Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

    "long_description": "Metriport provides real-time access to comprehensive medical data for 300M+ individuals across the US. Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more. If you want to do work that matters, get in touch with us today.",

Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\r\n\r\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:\r\n• Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n• Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n• Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued. We catch nuanced billing, coding, and contract errors to save 3-7% on annual claims spend. We work with self-insured employers and health plans.\r\n\r\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐔𝐬:\r\nAngel Onuoha (CEO) and Ahmad Shehu (CTO) have worked together for 4 years. Before Avelis Health they built Zuvy, a Lagos-based fintech company that provided invoice factoring to small businesses. Zuvy was acquired by The BAS Group in 2025.",

Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",
