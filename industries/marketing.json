Users receive an email with a link to the app in the App Store where they can purchase the app and a coupon code.\n\nOnce the app is purchased and downloaded, users are prompted to enter the coupon code once inside the Appâ€™s interface. The app can also be prompted by shaking the phone. Once the code is entered, TapZilla automatically puts the app cost in the buyerâ€™s PayPal account or can issue an iTunes gift card.",

We don’t want to debate the death of print books, or the birth of ebooks, we love and support them all. \r\n\r\nA typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don’t get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with.  We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers. Lastly, we use that same technology to keep overhead low, and we think that the bulk of the revenue from book sales should go back to the creative team that makes them happen.",
