While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.\r\n\r\nBig banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done?

This is expected to cost the industry $15B in human labor. We talked to these humans, and learned that they spend 1/3 of their time just asking other humans for documents and data that are almost universally available online. While the market is slowly moving to transactional data, Lendsnap is the only company helping lenders get ahead of the competition by delivering original electronic documents and data sets. That means portfolios of our lender customers stay completely liquid in the secondary market. No one else can offer that today.\r\n\r\nLendsnap instantly gathers the original borrower documents and data for lenders by linking to consumer financial accounts. We increase loan origination team productivity by 25%+ and save applicants several hours on each application as well. Our intuitive and easy-to-use workflow makes it easy and safe for borrowers to turn in and for loan officers to receive the necessary documents for lenders to make a credit decision.\r\n\r\nAs the only company delivering the right documents and data to originate non-agency loans such as VA, FHA, and subprime, we are able to work with all types of lenders. Furthermore, we are uniquely suited to serve mortgage brokers (12% market share) who have to remain flexible to the credit needs of their diverse borrowers. We are the only post-launch company that delivers actual electronic statements straight from source institutions, such as Bank of America, TurboTax, Chase, and hundreds more.",

We help couples easily manage their shared and household payments using our digital joint account.\r\n\r\nOver 20 million Indians marry each year, creating a $300 billion market opportunity in household expenses. Couples juggle multiple accounts, cards, and expense-tracking tools. Joint accounts involve lengthy paperwork, rejections, and minimum balance requirements, making them inconvenient for modern couples. Beyond married couples, this need extends to engaged partners, live-in couples, roommates, and families seeking simpler ways to manage shared expenses.\r\n\r\nCoupl offers a digital, zero-balance joint account with co-branded debit cards and in-app bill payments, set up in just 60 seconds. Couples can use the account for all shared expenses, with an analytics dashboard to help them stay on top of their finances.\r\n\r\nCoupl is powered by RuPay, NPCI and IDFC FIRST Bank.",
