    "website": "https://razorpay.com",
    "all_locations": "Bengaluru, KA, India",
    "long_description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \r\n\r\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \r\n\r\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \r\n\r\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money. \r\n\r\n",

As much as 60% of their sales happen on credit. That’s ~24% of the country’s GDP (500B$) lying on paper!\r\n\r\nOKCREDIT as a company came into existence to start solving the most important problem of credit recovery in MSMEs. We as first movers developed a bookkeeping app that would help any merchant sitting at the remotest corner of the country with internet connectivity to record his transactions digitally. We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers. So as a company our vision was to bring the data dark merchants onto the digital platform. We have changed the way the MSMEs record the transactions and eased their life today. \r\n\r\n",

    "long_description": "Volopay is a modern spend management platform that saves companies time and money by giving visibility & control to every aspect of business spending. With Volopay, finance and accounting teams can control expense requests and approvals, make bill payments (domestic/cross-border), manage company cards, and reconcile all accounting on one platform.\r\n\r\nVolopay completely eliminates the need for expense reports and reimbursements while giving everyone in the company a card to use. We worked in an offshore dev centre in the past and it took 2 months to get our reimbursements and 4 weeks to make any purchase as there was just one corporate card for the entire company and clunky bill payments solutions offered by the banks. \r\n\r\nAmong our customers are Reddoorz (OYO of South East Asia), Dathena (biggest data security co in Singapore) and Beam (APAC’s leading micro-mobility player).

Hiring billing specialists adds overhead and introduces human error right when you need to move fast.\r\n\r\nJustPaid makes billing effortless by extracting billing logic directly from your contracts—whether they're PDFs or stored in your CRM—and automatically generating accurate, timely invoices.\r\n\r\nAlready using Stripe, DocuSign, CommonPaper, HubSpot, or Salesforce? We integrate seamlessly with your existing stack.\r\n\r\nMaintain control while automating the complexity. No more pricing disputes. Faster cash flow. Fewer headaches.\r\n\r\n- Move fast: Bill customers from day one without hiring specialists\r\n- Scale smart: Handle complex pricing models without operational overhead\r\n- Stay focused: Spend time building your product, not managing invoices\r\n- Reduce risk: Eliminate human error in billing calculations\r\n\r\nWe're always asking ourselves: How can we make a company's financial operations effortless so teams can focus on scaling?\r\n\r\n- We don't settle\r\n- We are passionate\r\n- We are serial entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nWe aim to make a dent in the universe.",

    "long_description": "At Moreta, we simplify payments for international travelers, letting you pay for anything using just your phone. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching for the best cash exchange rates or ATMs on your next trip. With Moreta, paying local merchants is easy, and the best part? Transparent fees.\r\n\r\nWe came up with Moreta while on our own backpacking adventures. Watching locals pay with a simple scan while we fumbled with cards and cash. So, we created a solution. By syncing with local payment networks, Moreta lets you pay like a local securely and digitally, without needing a bank account in every country.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting in Asia, where QR code digital wallets are taking over and are now the top choice at checkout. As these wallets start to join forces for cross-border payments, Moreta will be the first to bridge the gap for international travelers from card-centric markets to seamlessly tap into these local networks. Moreta will target 67 million travelers arriving in the region each year, who together have $127 billion in everyday expenditure.",
