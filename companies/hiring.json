We focus on combinations because cancer is often difficult to target with just one drug and starting with a single drug can lead to resistant clones or relapse. We're building a highly automated lab in Foster City running on our custom software and are currently testing relapsed/refractory cancer patients as well as samples from a variety of pharma/biotech partnerships.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.notablelabs.com/careers",

    "website": "https://razorpay.com",
    "all_locations": "Bengaluru, KA, India",
    "long_description": "The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India’s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay’s growth has evolved to be an index of India’s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \r\n\r\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway ‘Curlec by Razorpay’ and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \r\n\r\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India’s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India’s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India’s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Razorpay’s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \r\n\r\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India’s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn’t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money. \r\n\r\n",

Travellers get the best price and they help local businesses avoid unnecessary fees. \r\n\r\nTravel experts, content creators and the friends you always ask for recommendations can use The Guide to showcase their favourite places to stay and things to do. When you book one of their recommendations, you’ll get a discount from the business and they receive bonus credit to say thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Tab platform gives independent tourism businesses the tools to improve their online presence, be discovered, take direct bookings — and also to take payments. Our payment platform is uniquely designed for tourism businesses, handling over 100 currencies natively, and every payment type securely and easily.\r\n\r\nAs travel returns after a difficult period, it’s time for a fresh approach. That’s why we’re building a social commerce platform for tourism — helping to spread the benefits of tourism far and wide, and helping travellers make the most of their precious time abroad. \r\n\r\nWe're headquartered in London, and backed by Y Combinator (the investors behind Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe).",

Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship.  Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time.  Since 2020, we’ve created and powered Externships for over 50,000 students on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and they’re time-consuming for employers to run.\r\n\r\nExternships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern.  Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students.\r\n\r\nBy making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy.  We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education – no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status.  Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship.\r\n\r\nExtern was born out of a pivot from Paragon One (W17) which initially focused on providing students with a career center-as-a-service platform, connecting them with industry professionals to receive career coaching and guidance.  Backed by Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, Launch Fund, University Ventures, and Learn Capital.",

We first launched an opioid product to support government and public health officials in responding to the opioid epidemic, and in 2020 launched a Covid19 product to estimate the scope and trend of the outbreak in communities. We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.\r\n\r\nBattling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database. Eventually, Biobot data will be an early warning system for disease outbreaks, a map of nutrition disparities, and more.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.biobot.io",

For 100+ years, breath analysis (AKA metabolic testing, VO2max) has been the gold standard in anti-aging quantification, nutrition prescription, and evaluation of most critical systems, including the heart, lungs, cells, and nervous system. Until recently, it was only available in sophisticated clinics and regarded as the most valuable but underutilized assessment in medicine. PNOĒ changed that through the first easy-to-use clinical-grade breath analysis device, proprietary software package, and dedicated metabolic expert support. Through a non-invasive 10 min breath test, PNOĒ analyzes the human breath and prescribes a personalized nutrition, exercise, breathwork, and bio-optimization (i.e., red light therapy, hyperbaric chamber, IV therapy, etc.) program based on one’s biological limitations. 3,000+ health professionals trust PNOĒ because it personalizes the clients’ journey through their clinics, builds retention by quantifying progress, and enables the upsell of personalized nutrition and breathwork. All this without any effort, time commitment, or upfront cost. PNOĒ has been independently validated by Georgetown University, VA in Maryland, and Rutgers University and is trusted by leading institutions including Cenegenics, Dais Cove, MIT, UCLA, Pan Pacific, CLMBR, UCS, OURA, TONAL, Spartan Racing, and Paris Saint Germain.

Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  \r\n\r\nI built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.\r\n",

    "long_description": "Getting clothes tailor-made is very common in India, especially for women. Saree blouses have to be tailor-made always due to their fitted nature & the non-stretchiness of typical Indian fabrics. \r\n\r\nThe tailoring market however, hasn't evolved at all. It is highly fragmented with a low NPS. The end user experience demands a significant amount of the customer's time, involving visits to a physical shop & avoidable back & forth. This is increasingly unviable for busy urban Indian women. We make it super easy by letting women place an order online, get fitted at the comfort of their homes, help them with styling their fabric & deliver the made-to-measure clothes directly to their doorstep.",

    "long_description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\r\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\r\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\r\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\r\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\r\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\r\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\r\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

But it’s also fragile. When the grid is compromised, everything grinds to a halt, and the consequences can be dire: wildfires burn, land is destroyed, property is damaged, progress stops, and lives are lost.  \r\n\r\nOur team builds smart sensors that help utility companies to immediately detect, find, and fix outages and take steps to prevent new outages, and other related disasters, from happening at all. The need for power will only increase. We protect the grid of today while we build the grid of tomorrow.  \r\n\r\nGridware is privately held and backed by the best climate-tech and Silicon Valley investors. We are headquartered in the Bay Area in northern California. ",

By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.\r\n \r\nREGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale flying demonstration vehicle. By this summer, REGENT will fly humans on the 15,000 lb (7000kg) first full-scale prototype seaglider, which will be the largest electric-flying machine in history.\r\n\r\nBy late 2026, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.  A 100 passenger version, already with firm orders, will follow several years later.\r\n\r\nIn just four years, REGENT has accumulated >$10B in pre-orders (including firm deposits) from airlines and ferry companies around the world.  Currently a team of 100, REGENT is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised over $100M to date from the likes of Founders Fund, Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Lockheed Martin, and is on contract with the US Marine Corps.",

Omnivore is faster, cheaper, and more practical than electric propulsion while being substantially less expensive, safer, and more operationally flexible than legacy chemical propulsion systems. Our Sutter Telescope System can identify and locate resource-rich asteroids and orbital debris that existing technologies can’t find and works synergistically with our Worker Bee OTV for orbital logistics. For government customers, Sutter can identify dark fast-moving objects between Earth and the Moon which currently evade detection, a critical issue for national defense and a key need of the Space Force. We are already using Sutter in ground-based observatories and will begin commercial sales of Sutter SDA data next month having tracked dozens of faint moving objects in space already. Once launched into space, Sutter will be 300,000 times more cost effective than any other known telescope design and will revolutionize sense making in space.",

Users can get instant quotes through our website (and eventually through integrations build on top of our API). We build custom internal software to command and control the operations of the factory. \r\n\r\nRight now we are actively working on fully automating the production of laser cut parts including scheduling, material movement, laser configuration, etc. Orders will be able to come in, and our software will control the factory and output parts ready to ship. \r\n\r\n",

As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.

Our first product is Carta for Web3, where companies can manage their cap tables and distribute their token equity to employees, advisors, or investors. We’re also building investor infrastructure for institutions to custody investments with on-chain execution and intelligence. Our ultimate goal is to use locked tokens as composable building blocks to power collateralized lending, liquid secondary markets, and other DeFi applications.\r\n\r\nLaunching a token? Let's chat. Are you receiving tokens from your investments? We can also be helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are our companies saying about the problem?\r\n\r\n> Having it all bundled together would make life easier. We have a million things to do. If you have an off-the-shelf thing, we’d use it.\r\n> This wouldn’t be a nice to have, it’d be a have to have.\r\n> Terrible process. We’re manually sending out transactions, going to solscan and manually check that they received our token. Takes hours every week.\r\n> Everything we do is potentially very dangerous. We have to check it thoroughly. I’ve spent several hours a day on this since launch. I imagine every month, it’ll take us at least 1-2 days.\r\n> Manual process every month for the ops team. They likely burn a week.... every month to pay out 150+ addresses.",

We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\r\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\r\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\r\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\r\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\r\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\r\nOur Products:\r\n\r\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\r\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

By embedding AI agents into care navigation, triage, and decision support, we reduce costs, accelerate outcomes, and personalize treatment at scale.\r\n\r\nOur hybrid care model blends targeted psychotherapy, psychiatric medication management, genetic testing, coaching, and holistic wellness—delivered by a curated workforce of women’s mental health specialists. Through continuous feedback loops, AI segmentation, and predictive insights, LunaJoy is built to scale.\r\n\r\nWe’re expanding our in-network footprint to make this care accessible across commercial and Medicaid populations—closing equity gaps for women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those most at risk.\r\n\r\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health conditions, and 3x more likely to endure trauma. Yet the system is still built for the “average” patient—ignoring the biological, emotional, and social complexity of women’s lives. LunaJoy is rearchitecting that system with AI at its core—because when we invest in women’s mental health, entire communities thrive.",

This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.\r\n\r\nAttain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out at founders@joinattain.com!",

There are over 100 deadly chronic conditions as 1 out of 2 Americans is currently living with at least 1 chronic condition. The US healthcare system has over $1 trillion dollars in direct costs. Medical adherence rates for therapeutic programs and medicine are only 50% because patients feel lonely, isolated, and unsupported in their chronic illness journey.\r\n\r\nReviving Mind is an in-network telehealth provider that improves clinical outcomes and program adherence for the senior medicare and medicare-advantage population that is plagued with loneliness and chronic illness. This is done through a novel and proprietary clinical program and technology platform that integrates virtual, private, curated, and professionally led groups that scale up to 8-patients with individualized and goal oriented lifestyle medicine coaching that is automated but managed by a licensed provider.\r\n\r\nScaling rapidly across the United States.",

As a result, teams waste months on brittle infrastructure instead of conducting research and building their core product.\r\n\r\nEventual was founded in 2022 to solve this. Our mission is to make querying any kind of data, images, video, audio, text, as intuitive as working with tables, and powerful enough to scale to production workloads. Our open-source engine, Daft, is purpose-built for real-world AI systems: coordinating with external APIs, managing GPU clusters, and handling failures that traditional engines can’t. Daft already powers critical workloads at companies like Amazon, Mobileye, Together AI, and CloudKitchens.\r\n\r\nWe’ve assembled a world-class team from Databricks, AWS, Nvidia, Pinecone, GitHub Copilot, Tesla, and more, quadrupling our size within a year. With backing from Y Combinator, Caffeinated Capital, Array.vc, and top angels from the co-founders of Databricks and Perplexity, we’re looking to double the team now.

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify brands deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 80% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

We've built AI agents that handle scheduling, billing, prescription refills, and more—serving tens of thousands of patients monthly.\r\n\r\nWe're growing rapidly, serving dozens of customers including virtual care companies, outpatient health systems, and a $5B publicly traded health insurance company. With demand surging and revenue quadrupling in recent months, we're scaling our team.\r\n\r\nWe are an in-person company based in New York. We've raised $5.3M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout), and founders of Ophelia, Medallion, Counsel, Elemy, and Sana. \r\n\r\nOur clinician-led founding team combines healthcare operations expertise with technical excellence. Dr. Ryan Gallagher, our CEO, is a Stanford/Harvard-trained physician from the founding teams of Two Chairs and Ophelia (YC W20). Jeffrey Lamothe, our CTO, worked on voice AI at Amazon Alexa and led AI/ML projects at Salesforce and Citi.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we transform healthcare communication. We're creating a future where patients receive faster resolutions, staff are happier, and providers have more time for what matters most: patient care.",

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Designing a new therapeutic can take decades and billions of dollars, and even our best industrial catalysts work at a snail’s pace compared to their theoretical optimums.\r\n\r\nAnthrogen is changing that. By training massive AI foundation models on protein sequences and structures, we’ve unlocked the ability to generate—on demand—completely novel molecular machines with atomic-level precision. Simply describe the function you need, and our platform imagines the peptide or protein that will deliver it.\r\n\r\nWe're building models to speed up billions of years of evolution into the span of an afternoon's worth of compute.\r\n\r\nThe result? New-to-nature therapies, ultra-efficient catalysts for sustainable manufacturing, and a whole new frontier of molecular innovation—designed as precisely as any cutting-edge aircraft or microchip.",

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM—traditionally scattered across multiple systems—into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy.

We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year.

With Waypoint, cities can generate reports in months rather than years, and at 30% of the cost.\r\n\r\nVarun and Ryan met at Stanford, where they graduated with degrees in CS and EE respectively. Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\r\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $50B/year on planning. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor.

We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams.
