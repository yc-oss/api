    "long_description": "Recidiviz is a non-profit technology company that drives meaningful changes in criminal justice systems and improved outcomes for justice-impacted individuals.\r\n\r\nCriminal justice data today is inefficient and ineffective: researchers, advocates, policymakers and practitioners each need funding and time for data collection and cleaning (for almost any data at all), and most data collected is too stale by the time it’s compiled to be useful.\r\n\r\nRecidiviz has built an open-source platform to ingest data from across data silos, link it, standardize it, and expose it in usable formats to the ecosystem. We provide products and analyses on top of this platform to help government agencies understand how their justice systems are functioning, set and track progress towards goals, drive evidence-based improvements to practice and policy, and ensure justice-impacted folks reenter their communities as safely and quickly as they can.",
