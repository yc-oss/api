  "long_description": "TerrAvion provides high revisit rate aerial imagery for agriculture.  Since 2016 we have been the largest volume provider.  \n\n\nTerrAvion Aerial is the best value for growers in imagery:  \n   -Imagery helps you to act in season in a comprehensive and quantitative way\n   -Satellites aren't reliability and lack sufficient resolution for agronomic decision-making\n   -Drones don't scale, and thus are expensive and a hassle\n   -TerrAvion beats all competitors on cost/value, flight rate, reliability, speed, and open API\n   -TerrAvion's service allows imagery to be used in tangible value creating use cases with agronomic support\n\nTerrAvion creates the most value for our agronomic partners:\n   -Excellent margins are possible when customers are concentrated, still affordable when in new markets\n   -Our program allows for bundling, particularly with agronomic recommendations\n   -We stay out of the advice and prescription side of things to make our agronomic partners stars\n   -Partners have full access to API with all data we collect for use in all their applications\n   -We handle the technical aspects of aerial imagery delivery and education with in-field support under our co-delivery model",
