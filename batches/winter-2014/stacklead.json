  "long_description": "StackLead automatically analyzes sales leads. \n\nStarting with only an email address, we pull together all the research a sales rep needs to understand a lead and their business. With this information, sales teams close more deals because they can effectively tailor their messaging and they don't have to spend time manually researching every new lead.\n\nYou can access StackLead research wherever you need it. If you already have an internal email when a user signs up, you can forward it to StackLead and we'll reply with a complete research report. We also provide a Salesforce integration (stacklead.com/blog/qualifying-leads-in-salesforce-with-stacklead/) and webhooks API (stacklead.com/docs).\n\nGet started at stacklead.com or contact us at team@stacklead.com",
