  "long_description": "Curebase is reinventing decentralized clinical trials to help the vast majority of potential patients that currently cannot access clinical research. Curebaseâ€™s vision is that any patient, no matter where they are located, should be able to participate in clinical trials at home and with their own doctors. This is made possible through a unique suite of tools, including all-in-one eClinical software and virtual research sites, designed to engage patients in clinical trials across all settings, be it at home, at their local clinic, or other places in their community.",
