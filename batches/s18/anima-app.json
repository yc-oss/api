  "long_description": "Anima is converting design to code, automatically.\r\n\r\nWhy does the world need Anima?\r\nTaking user-interface design to production is hard.\r\nAutomated design-to-code will change the way we build software.\r\n\r\nThe future of Front-end\r\nWith Anima, designers can translate design to code in a single click.\r\n- Need a website? Designers can create one directly from their design tool. Figma, Adobe XD,  or Sketch.\r\n- Need to go from a prototype to a PoC asap? No coding required here as well.\r\n- For engineers, it's a coding assistant, keeping developers in control. \r\n  Less grunt work, pushing-pixels, and design that is lost in translation.",
