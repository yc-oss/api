  "long_description": "As healthcare costs have increased, the patient's home has become incredibly important as a site of care. Yet, patients recovering at home are highly underserved.\r\n\r\nPatients can only get better at home if they receive the high-quality care that they need reliably. The existing in-home care process involves patchwork of different vendors, all connected through faxes by nurses. We're building modern, robust software that solves this challenge and brings this market online.",
