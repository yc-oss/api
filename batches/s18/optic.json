  "long_description": "We help developers collaborate at scale and build better APIs. Optic’s open source tools makes it easy for developers to document API changes, review each other’s API changes during code review, and catch breaking changes before they reach production. \r\n\r\n**tl;dr** It’s version control but for behavior not code. We are taking the really successful ideas from Git / Code Review / CI  and applying them to API descriptions and (future) other non-code artifacts. \r\n\r\nEngineers at [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) use Optic daily to make the new Snyk API great.
