  "long_description": "Mytos builds machines that automate the growing of human cells for biotech and pharma companies. Our machines sit on-prem at customer sites, growing cells which they use for testing during early-stage drug development.\r\n\r\nEven though testing on cells is so critical for developing new drugs, today they're all grown totally manually, the same as 100 years ago! With our machines, for the first time our customers can hands-off manipulate and monitor batches of cells from the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe've already working with some of the biggest pharma companies. Mytos has the opportunity to change the way the entire industry works - join us and help us get there!",
