  "long_description": "Landed helps employers develop programs that increase access to homeownership for their employees. We do this by unlocking the power of shared appreciation to create down payment programs tailored to the needs of each institution, improving recruitment and retention of key talent. Unlike other programs, shared appreciation is mutually beneficial to funders and buyers, creating a self-renewing pool of capital that recycles as homebuyers exit the program.",
