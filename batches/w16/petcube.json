Its first product, Petcube Camera, is an interactive pet monitor with real time video and built-in laser pointer. It allows pet owners to watch, talk to, and play with their pet from their smartphone, no matter where they are. \r\n\r\nFounded in Kyiv in 2013, Petcube was funded on Kickstarter and became one of the most successful crowdfunding pet products in history. Since graduating from the prestigious Y-Combinator incubation program, Petcube has gone on to launch two additional products, Petcube Play and Petcube Bites, as well as a cloud video recording service, Petcube Care. Petcube products are available online and in stores including Brookstone, Best Buy, and Petco.",
