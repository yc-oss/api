  "long_description": "AmberBox is the most advanced indoor gunshot detection and response system used in the US today. AmberBox automates emergency processes to significantly reduce response time and remove human error.\r\n\r\nAmberBox detectors utilise a patented gunshot detection algorithm to respond immediately following a firearm discharge. With tri-factor authentication (percussion, audio and infrared), detectors are able to instantly determine a firearm signature with a near-zero false alarm rate. Upon activation, detectors alert first responders through our reporting network, and can integrate with other security systems, such as cameras, access control systems and mass notification to initiate.",
