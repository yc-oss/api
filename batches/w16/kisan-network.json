  "long_description": "Kisan Network is a tech enabled and fully integrated PAN India agri produce supply chain. We connect small and marginal farmers directly to businesses anywhere in the country, with each step digitally captured and monitored on our proprietary management portal. As a result, farmers are able to earn 10% more than prevalent market prices for their produce.\r\n\r\nOur system, built on the 3 pillars of \r\n1) 100% integration\r\n2) Standardisation w.r.t. on-field practices and,\r\n3) Transparency for all stakeholders\r\n\r\nis a departure from the opaque and inconsistent traditional supply chain which thrives on the high levels of fragmentation in the ecosystem. There is 0% use of paper in our entire chain, with specific focus on building a national agri repository of micro level stakeholder information and on image / data driven automated crop quality assessment.",
