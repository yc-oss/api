  "long_description": "Compgun is founded on the simple premise that sales commissions are simultaneously the sales organization's single biggest strategic lever and its largest expense.\n\nAt previous companies, Tim and Jake were amazed by the effectiveness of sales commissions in rallying teams around new strategic priorities and business objectives. At the same time, they were shocked by how primitively commission expenses are often managed. Most businesses administer commissions with Excel and email, making it nearly impossible for sales reps or their managers to track how they are pacing throughout the month, let alone which transactions were included in a previous period’s paycheck. Compgun’s mission is to stand the status quo on it’s head by providing real-time performance tracking and insight to every member of the sales org.",
