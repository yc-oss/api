  "long_description": "When footage comes off a camera, post-production teams spend hours organizing their project, assembling rough cuts, reviewing for changes and mistakes, and sending the right links to the right people. Aspect is a platform with agents that understand a team’s video library and workflows better than humans. These agents fill the roles of a media team’s post-production assistant, so creatives can focus on what they love instead of managing media back-office tasks.",
