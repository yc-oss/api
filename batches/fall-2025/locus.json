  "long_description": "We make your agents pay.\r\n\r\nAs agents evolve from tools into dependable, autonomous actors, they’ll need the ability to execute open-ended workflows end-to-end.\r\n\r\nThis inevitably means payments: accessing paywalled data, transacting for services or with other specialist agents. But autonomy requires guardrails. Businesses and developers will need a way to ensure their agents only spend how much and on what they’re supposed to.\r\n\r\nThe machine economy is coming, and Locus (YC F25) is building the connector businesses will need to participate. We connect agents securely to funds, letting you define permissions and limits for every transaction. Each payment is traceable, auditable, and fully reconcilable with your existing financial stack.",
