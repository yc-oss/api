It replaces internal forms, manual Slack triage, and scattered docs with an AI front desk that understands requests, assigns owners, updates context, and posts status changes directly into Slack. Rovr’s built-in ops CRM gives teams a single system of record for eng requests — from tooling access to platform incidents to dev-infra workflows — reducing operational drag across the entire org.",
