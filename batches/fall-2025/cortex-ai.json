  "long_description": "Cortex AI builds the world’s most diverse and large-scale real-world workplace robot & egocentric dataset — where the physical world becomes the next training and evaluation set for embodied AI.\r\n\r\nWe power frontier labs developing robotics foundation models and general-purpose robots by providing the data they need:\r\n1️⃣ Egocentric Data — real-workplace human video with hand/body pose, depth, and subtask labels.\r\n2️⃣ Robot Data — trajectories collected from manipulators and humanoids in real industry settings.\r\n3️⃣ Human-in-the-Loop Rollouts & Evals — real-world deployments with remote operators who recover robots when they fail, capturing data that feeds back into training and continuously improves models.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, through the Cortex Marketplace, workplaces get paid to host data-collection and evaluation sessions, while labs access the in-the-wild data that truly matters. This draws on Lucas’s previous experience as co-founder of Carousell, a C2C marketplace that scaled to a $1B+ valuation.",
