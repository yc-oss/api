  "long_description": "We've built an AI property manager that automates maintenance for Landlord's and Property Managers. Brickwise handles tenant calls and messages 24/7, following up by chasing contractors and resolving payments.\r\n\r\nThis provides higher tenant satisfaction, while also simplifying the workloads of property managers. Our property manager operates across all communication channels, including SMS, WhatsApp, phone calls, and email, making it easy to integrate with existing workflows.",
