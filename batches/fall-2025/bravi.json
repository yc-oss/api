Our platform answers calls, chats, and emails instantly, pre-qualifies prospects, and follows up until a quote is sent, turning missed opportunities into revenue.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™re already working with top installers in shutters, solar, and construction. For example, one client uncovered 1000+ missed calls per month that Bravi now converts into $1M+ of potential revenue.",
