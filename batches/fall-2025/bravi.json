  "long_description": "Bravi is building the AI operating system for home-services businesses, using AI-powered customer communication as the wedge.\r\n\r\nWe replace the front office (calls, chats, follow-ups) with AI agents that never miss a lead, then layer an internal AI copilot that understands products, pricing, and technical documentation.\r\n\r\nWe started with fenestration (shutters, windows, garage doors), a large, complex vertical with no modern software, before expanding to adjacent trades.\r\n\r\nBravi is already live with leading installers and manufacturers across Europe and the US, turning missed demand into revenue.",
