  "long_description": "Redapto builds self-improving systems for customer support teams that boost CSAT, NRR, and drive repeat purchases.\r\n\r\nSupport quality plateau because agents and QA are static. Less than 5% of interactions are reviewed, missing SOP gaps, hallucinations, and outdated knowledge. Redapto audits 100% of interactions to detect issues, run custom evals, and auto-update SOPs, training, and knowledge bases so teams continuously improve.\r\n\r\nWe’re applied researchers who’ve shipped this at scale. At Coinbase, our agent automations save $2.5M+ annually; at Adobe and Amazon, our post-training and compression work saved $1M+ and improved latency 20×. ",
