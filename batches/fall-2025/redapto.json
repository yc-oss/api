  "long_description": "Redapto fixes the core limitation of today’s agents: they’re static. Teams hit real performance walls because models aren’t optimized for their domain and don’t improve from usage. We help products break that plateau.\r\n\r\nWe bring continuous improvement into your stack: controller models for intelligent context engineering, domain-specialized mid/post-training, automatic feedback pipelines, and self-updating data sources so RAG/search stays accurate. We focus only on what moves the needle for your product, not extra infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe’re applied researchers who’ve shipped this at scale. At Coinbase, our agent automations save $2.5M+ annually; at Adobe and Amazon, our post-training and compression work saved $1M+ and improved latency 20×. We’ve published at NeurIPS, AAAI, ICLR, and COLING, and we’re building Redapto to make adaptive, evolving agents the new default.",
