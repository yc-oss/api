It can send follow-ups, research leads, or add deals with a simple prompt. No complex UI, drop-downs or fields, simply ask.\r\n\r\nFor repeatable work, you build Agents that you can train like new hires, simply by writing documents that describe your processes. item Agents run business processes across sales, support, and account management autonomously.",
