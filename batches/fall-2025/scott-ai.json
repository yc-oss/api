Let coding agents take on larger tasks.\r\n\r\nScott came from our own pain trying to build with coding agents on products that serve millions of users. We realized that the real productivity blocker is no longer coding speed. It’s ensuring that coding agents are aligned with developer intent. Scott AI addresses this problem by re-imagining the software design process with coding agents as first class participants.",
