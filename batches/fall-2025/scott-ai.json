  "long_description": "Scott AI is the agentic workspace where teams align on specs before any codegen runs.\r\n\r\nTeams use multiple coding agents. Different agents will have different strengths. An engineer will entrust a long-running agent to add dark-mode end-to-end while they pair carefully with an IDE-based agent on a critical DB migrations in parallel. These execution agents can’t be used for plan alignment because they are biased to their own tool. Scott is the missing layer that will link agent agnostic high-level intent to code agent workloads. Teams will use Scott as their shared decision layer to structure plans, surface tradeoffs, and empower developers to determine which parts of the plan each coding agent should handle.",
