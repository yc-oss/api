  "long_description": "Get to your best spec faster. Align with your team faster. Let coding agents take on larger tasks. Scott lets teams orchestrate “swarms of experts” to debate architecture designs, making it easy for developers to discover and align on the best plan before handing it off to execution-oriented agents like Claude, Codex, or Cursor.\r\n\r\nScott came from our own pain trying to build with coding agents on products that serve millions of users. We realized that the real productivity blocker is no longer coding speed. It’s ensuring that coding agents are aligned with developer intent. Scott AI addresses this problem by re-imagining the software design process with coding agents as first class participants.",
