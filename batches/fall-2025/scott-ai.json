  "long_description": "Scott AI is the agentic workspace where teams align on spec before any codegen runs.\r\n\r\nTeams already use multiple coding agents to build. Different coding agents will continue to evolve and have diverse strengths. An engineer will entrust a long-running agent to add dark-mode end-to-end while they pair carefully with an IDE-based agent to land a critical DB migration. These execution agents cannot be the decision layer because they are biased to their own tool, they are not neutral. Scott AI is the neutral, agent agnostic decision layer for the age of multi agent building. Teams will use Scott as their decision workspace to finally ditch google docs and notion as their primary spec alignment layer.",
