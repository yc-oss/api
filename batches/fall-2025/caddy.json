  "long_description": "Caddy is the operating system that works proactively for you. It learns how you work and acts on your behalf, keeping work moving while your context and voice stay intact.\r\n\r\nInstead of producing generic AI output, Caddy creates real work artifacts that sound like you and fit how you actually work. Today, it operates across the tools you use every day, including email, calendar, Slack, Linear, and Notion.\r\n\r\nCaddy is built by the team behind Loom’s AI and core product. We believe the next era of computing is software that understands intent, handles ambiguous work, and quietly gets work done in the background.",
