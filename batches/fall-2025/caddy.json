  "long_description": "We are building Siri for work, but it actually works. Caddy turns your voice into the next computing interface. It understands what’s on your screen and your intent, so work gets done while you stay in flow.\r\n\r\nSay “create a Linear ticket and share it to Slack” and Caddy handles it instantly in the background.\r\n\r\nCaddy’s founders previously led product and design for Loom’s AI suite and core products. We believe the next era of computing will be powered by voice, where computers understand what you say and what’s on your screen so work happens naturally.",
