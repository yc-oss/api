Insurance claim follow-up calls account for 80% of the daily workload of a healthcare billing team, with each call going for an average of 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n Our customers see 10x increase in the number of claims followed up per biller in the first week and we have converted 100% of our pilots to paying customers. Since our launch in July 2025, we have automated 60k+ phone calls. We are now at $428K ARR, with signed pilots that will take us to $1.28M in contracted ARR by January. We have signed partnerships with top healthcare leaders like UC health systems, Mayo Clinic, Experian Health and more.\r\n\r\nThe founders have known each other for over a year.
