  "long_description": "LunaBill is building AI Voice callers for healthcare billing teams. Insurance claim follow-up calls account for the 80% of the daily workload of a healthcare billing team, with each call averaging 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nSince our launch in July we are now at $764K in contracted ARR, of which $428K is live revenue and the rest will go live by January 2026. Our customers see a 10x increase in claims followed up per biller in the first week and we have converted 100% of pilots to paying customers. We have automated 50,000+ calls and signed partnerships with top healthcare leaders like UC health systems, Mayo, Experian Health and more.\r\n\r\nThe founders have known each other for over a year. Suhail is a 2x founder, with 3+ years of experience building in healthcare including operating a medical billing company with 200+ healthcare clients. David founded Skiesoft, Taiwan’s biggest healthcare AI scribe company, used by 120k+ healthcare professionals. He also worked as a data scientist at UCSF, building models to audit medical-coding accuracy. Yash was a researcher at various hospital systems including Mayo Clinic.\r\n",
