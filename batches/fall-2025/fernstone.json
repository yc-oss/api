We are competing with the 40,000 insurance brokers that sell $500B in commercial premium each year.\r\n\r\nBefore starting Fernstone, Luke and James met at Traba (Series A) when they started on the same day. Luke led a Growth team, closing some of Traba’s largest customers like JB Hunt and Kimberly Clark. James created and led Traba’s Enterprise function, growing it to 25% of company revenue. Bryant, James’ classmate from high school, was a Software Engineer at Sentilink and Google.\r\n",
