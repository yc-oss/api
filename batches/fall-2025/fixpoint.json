We’re building the network of experts and the platform to automate sourcing, vetting, and deploying them on AI training projects.\r\n\r\nIt used to be a manual process to staff people on AI training data or eval projects - but Fixpoint leverages AI to staff people and create data better, cheaper, and faster.
