  "long_description": "Imagine AI clones you, not just your voice. We build you online with high-fidelity personas that replicate how you think, write, and sell - so our AI can handle your entire B2B content pipeline: posts, strategic comments, blogs and content engineering to achieve content-market fit.\r\n\r\nFor B2B service firms and YC companies, this means turning founders' expertise into a pipeline-generating machine. Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this). \r\n\r\nWe launched in November, now serve 40+ paying customers (Series-A,B and seed stage companies plus VCs, global franchises, and ghostwriting agencies). Achieving minimum 30%-70% week to week growth.\r\n\r\n💡 Results:\r\n$20 M+ total revenue generated across clients\r\n$5 M deal closed from a single LinkedIn post\r\n$40 K inbound revenue in 1.5 weeks for one client\r\n200+ qualified inbounds in 1 month after hitting content-market fit\r\n\r\nWe’re not just another AI tool.\r\n\r\nWe’re forward-deployed content engineers, building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company.\r\n\r\n📅 Book a demo: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost\r\n\r\n🔗 Connect with Sky: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",
