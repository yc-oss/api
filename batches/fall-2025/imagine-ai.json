  "long_description": "Imagine AI clones you, not just your voice. We build you online with high-fidelity personas that replicate how you think, write, and sell - so our AI can handle your entire B2B content pipeline: posts, strategic comments, blogs for SEO/GEO and content engineering to achieve content-market fit.\r\n\r\nFor B2B service firms and YC companies, this means turning founders' expertise into a pipeline-generating machine. Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this). The idea came after a YC partner told us: founders at B2B companies are experts at their jobs, but consistently struggle to turn that expertise into marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched in mid-July, now serve 30+ paying customers including 14 YC companies (Conduit W24, Prism X25, Freya AI S25, Strac W22, Hyperspell F25) plus VCs, global franchises, and ghostwriting agencies. Achieving minimum 30%-70% week to week growth.\r\n\r\nðŸ’¡ Results:\r\n$10 M+ total revenue generated across clients\r\n$5 M deal closed from a single LinkedIn post\r\n$40 K inbound revenue in 1.5 weeks for one client\r\n200+ qualified inbounds in 1 month after hitting content-market fit\r\n\r\nWeâ€™re not just another AI tool.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™re forward-deployed content engineers, building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company.\r\n\r\nðŸ“… Book a demo: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost\r\n\r\nðŸ”— Connect with Sky: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",
