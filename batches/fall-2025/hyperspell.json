  "long_description": "Hyperspell (YC F25) gives AI agents memory.\r\n\r\nIt connects to tools like Slack, Gmail, Notion, and Drive so agents can recall, reason, and remember across company knowledge. Developers use Hyperspell’s API to turn disconnected agents into AI coworkers that understand their work. Conor and Manu founded Hyperspell after building their own workplace agent and seeing how limited AI is without memory. They have over 15 years of experience in machine learning and have scaled API-based products to $30M ARR.",
