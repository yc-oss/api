  "long_description": "€5,000 in additional bookings. In 4 weeks. For a 53-room hotel.\r\n\r\nWe help hotel groups turn missed calls into bookings.\r\n\r\nThis it how it works: \r\n\r\n- They send their missed calls to us.\r\n- Our AI answers and takes the booking.\r\n- The booking goes right into their PMS.\r\n\r\nEven with call centers and central reservation departments they are still losing 5% of calls. \r\n\r\nThat is a seven figure revenue leak. We already work with 7 hotel groups that run 350 hotels recover that potential.\r\n\r\nWhy us? \r\nWe used to build software that can’t fail for massive companies. We started Codyco after a friend told us how much money he was losing from missed calls. We built the first version just for him.\r\n\r\nNow we give hotel groups the reliable AI they need, so they never lose a booking on the phone again.",
