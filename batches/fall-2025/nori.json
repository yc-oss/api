  "long_description": "Nori is a concierge-level AI health coach in your pocket. \r\n\r\nIt takes all of your health data—Apple Health, medical records, wearables, everything—and boils it down into a personalized daily plan.\r\n\r\nUsers love it: “It's truly one of the best apps and I check it first every day. Since using Nori, I've been limiting devices in bed and eating earlier—and I'll be damned if it's not working... I started getting more deep sleep, my resting HR dropped to 43, my recovery improved.”—Jen, Nori user\"\r\n",
