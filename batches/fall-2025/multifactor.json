  "long_description": "The agentic era is here, but its foundation is dangerously insecure. A growing number of high-profile \"AI agent gone rogue\" security incidents make headlines each week.\r\n\r\nAs enterprise adoption of agentic software has far outpaced the development of applicable cybersecurity solutions, CISOs have loudly voiced a growing need for verifiable, fine-grained security controls on complex multi-agent systems. That's why we built Multifactor.\r\n\r\nMultifactor offers best-in-class authentication, authorization, and auditing technologies for agentic systems, allowing users to securely and revocably share online accounts with agents while maintaining fine-grained permissions and a detailed event history. We are doing for AI security what Cloudflare did for web security, Okta did for identity security, and Wiz did for cloud security: defining the category.\r\n\r\nA world-class \"account manager\" that allows agents to securely use online accounts on your behalf is just the startâ€”our early enterprise partners include companies using AI agents to manage $7.5+ billion manufacturing supply chains, where the consequences for lapses in security are severe. Our patented AI security technology seamlessly integrates with existing agentic software to thwart attacks like prompt injection, so CISOs and end users alike can breathe a sigh of relief, without slowing the pace of AI adoption.",
