  "long_description": "JSX Tool is a browser extension that hooks into your React project, so you can easily locate any React component and file with just a click. This gives developers the ability to articulate visual requests to LLMs that without JSX Tool, are either vague or cumbersome to communicate in English and code snippets. On top of that JSX Tool is a full featured IDE tailored specifically for React Development, so users never have to leave the context of their browser when developing React code.",
