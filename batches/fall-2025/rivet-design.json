  "long_description": "Rivet is a visual AI editor for product designers to make UI changes.  Designers ship the changes they make directly to their codebase. \r\n\r\nThe most painful problem for designers today is that their vision doesn't match code.  Rivet replaces slow collaboration between designers and engineers by letting designers just do it themselves. Rivet's editor helps turn product designers into design engineers.\r\n \r\nDesign-led companies in YC are Rivet customers.\r\n\r\nLearn more at rivet.design",
