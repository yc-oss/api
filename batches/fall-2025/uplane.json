The landing pages we generate convert up to 3-times as well as the status quo. Even the best marketing managers in the world can’t beat AI at personalization and A/B testing.\r\n\r\nDigital marketing is a $740B market with a 10% CAGR. Uplane charges a base fee plus up to 10% of ad spend, outperforming marketing agencies that typically charge 10-30%.",
