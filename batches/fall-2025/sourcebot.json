  "long_description": "Sourcebot is an open source code understanding platform for massive codebases. We’re used by thousands of engineers in some of the largest companies in the world, including NVIDIA, Red Hat, Wikimedia, and Arista Networks.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding code, not writing it, is the primary bottleneck for large engineering teams. For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe (Brendan and Michael) met a decade ago at McGill University, and have been building together full time for over 2 years. We’ve personally felt the pain of understanding large codebases while working at Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, Google, and Meta.",
