  "long_description": "Sourcebot is an open source code understanding platform for massive codebases. We 10x developer and AI agent productivity by building the tools to wrangle code complexity at scale.\r\n\r\nSourcebot started as a code search tool that hit the front page of Hacker News. Since then, we’ve built the first AI search that works across thousands of repos, gained 2.6k+ GitHub stars, and been installed 80k+ times. Today, we’re used by thousands of engineers in some of the largest companies in the world, including NVIDIA, Red Hat, Wikimedia, and Arista Networks.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding code, not writing it, is the primary bottleneck for large engineering teams. For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase. Being open source and self-hosted means we can reach the largest enterprises in ways others cannot.\r\n\r\nWe (Brendan and Michael) met a decade ago at McGill University, and have been building together full time for over 2 years. We’ve personally felt the pain of understanding large codebases while working at Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft, Google, and Meta.",
