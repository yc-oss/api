  "long_description": "Exonic is building a global network of intelligence to cure disease.\r\n\r\nWe are the first drug discovery company open to everyone.\r\n\r\nToday drug discovery is siloed - secretive, adversarial institutions in glass towers.\r\n\r\nBiological AI is changing the rules. Every day drug discovery becomes more of a computational problem.\r\n\r\nExonic is turning drug discovery into an open, meritocratic tournament.\r\n\r\nWe are advised by world leaders in bio AI, including the former Head of AI at Ginkgo Bioworks, and the first author of Evo (cover of Science). \r\n\r\nAll of the best biological AI models are open source. And on Exonic, you can combine them, prompt them, and share your innovative workflows without writing a single line of code. \r\n\r\nUsing Exonic Studio, we just beat a state-of-the-art benchmark in liver cancer (HepG2) synthetic enhancer design, validated in our wet lab.\r\n\r\nThe platform just went live - you can start right now.\r\n\r\nWe are turning the internet into a drug discovery powerhouse.",
