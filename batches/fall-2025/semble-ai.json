  "long_description": "Semble AI builds AI agents that design building-systems (fire, HVAC, plumbing, security). Construction companies use Semble to cut down weeks on commercial and residential projects. \r\n\r\nThe $600B building-system integration industry still runs on spreadsheets and manual drawings, even as building codes rapidly evolve and become more localized. It’s a massive blind spot for the tech world. \r\n\r\nJonathan and Ethan met studying computer science at Stanford. Jonathan worked at Convergint, one of the world's largest building system integrators, specifically for the purpose of learning how this industry works. Ethan is obsessed for a different reason: His house burned down in 2017 due to a faulty fire system.\r\n\r\nThey are determined to make Semble the industry standard for construction design.\r\n",
