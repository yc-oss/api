  "long_description": "Iris connects all your calendars and inboxes in one place with a built in personal assistant. It connects with Gmail, Google Calendar, Maps, and more to understand your context - what you’re working on, who you’re meeting, and where you need to be - and intelligently organizes your time around what actually matters. \r\n\r\nUnlike assistants that just schedule events, Iris learns your rhythm and automates your workflow: drafting emails, moving meetings, blocking focus time, and coordinating across accounts, all with your approval. \r\n\r\nWe’re building the next generation of personal AI, one that keeps you ahead.",
