  "long_description": "Play Health is building a perimenopause care platform to provide women and their providers with the tools they need to relieve symptoms fast. It is led by technical, second-time, YC-backed founders Andrea Mazzocchi, PhD and Ian Miller, with an exit and a unicorn between them.\r\n\r\nOver 30 million women in the U.S. are experiencing perimenopause symptoms, spending an estimated $15B+ annually on symptom management.  Despite this most only receive generic solutions and struggle to find effective symptom relief.\r\n\r\nWe're bringing evidence-based perimenopause care to women through partnerships with medical practices and employer and health benefits programs. Our platform integrates personalized symptom, medication, and lifestyle data to generate AI-powered insights and  clinical protocols, enabling providers to deliver specialized care.\r\n\r\nEvery clinical interaction enriches our longitudinal dataset allowing us to create better outcomes for patients, deeper insights for providers, and expand into women’s health broadly. This also enables us to partner with pharma and biotech companies developing therapeutics and diagnostics for women's health.",
