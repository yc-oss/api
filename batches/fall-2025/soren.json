  "long_description": "Soren is an AI engineer designed specifically for evals.\r\n\r\nToday, teams spend countless hours creating evals and maintaining them every time a new feature ships. When they finally run those evals, they’re met with a pile of logs and traces, but little clarity on what actually went wrong or how to fix it.\r\n\r\nSoren changes that with powerful agents that work alongside your team. It reasons across failed test cases to pinpoint root causes, then runs targeted experiments to surface better-performing solutions. New cases are added whenever new behaviors are detected, so engineers can stop doing ad-hoc maintenance.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the foundation for AI systems that can eventually evaluate and improve themselves.",
