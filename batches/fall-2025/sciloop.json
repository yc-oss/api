  "long_description": "Sciloop is building an AI Co-Scientist that automates experimentation and analysis for machine learning researchers, allowing them to test ideas far faster than today’s tools allow. We are Bilal and Osman, International Physics Olympiad medalists and the only Pakistanis admitted to MIT in our respective years, with several years of hands-on ML research experience inside MIT CSAIL. We have built large-scale training pipelines, worked with terabyte-scale datasets, and seen the research bottleneck firsthand while contributing to scientific ML projects. We left MIT to solve this problem directly and are now building a system that can eventually accelerate scientific discovery itself.\r\nhttps://sciloop.dev ",
