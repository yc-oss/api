  "long_description": "We build AI agents that automate the accounts payable process for enterprises.\r\n\r\nDesigned to imitate accounts payable clerks, our AI agents read emails and find valid invoices, extract data from any document format, perform matching with purchase orders and receipts, route invoices organization-wide for approval, and sync directly with your ERP or accounting system. \r\n\r\nWe're the only AP automation solution on the market that's already leveraging the latest AI vision models instead of outdated OCR technology, achieving 94% higher accuracy than industry leaders and helping our users see an 83% reduction in time spent.",
