  "long_description": "When footage comes off a camera today, media teams still lose hours dumping files into generic storage, renaming and sorting folders, hunting for past shots, assembling rough cuts by hand, and passing around review links in Slack and email.\r\n\r\nAspect is an AI-native video file system that understands a team’s library and day-to-day workflows. Today, teams use Aspect to migrate footage from Dropbox/Drive/servers into a single library, search it through chat (“show me where Dr. Brown used a robotic forcep”), leave timestamped feedback and mark up frames, generate rough draft sequences, and automatically route the right clips into tools like ClickUp and Slack. The platform offloads the organizing, searching and routing work, so teams can spend more time making content and companies can achieve a higher ROI on their library.",
