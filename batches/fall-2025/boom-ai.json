  "long_description": "Boom builds the AI employee for e-commerce — an agent that manages every customer interaction across WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and web chat. It answers product questions, supports customers with orders, follows up on abandoned checkouts, restocks, and repeat purchases, and even runs marketing campaigns. Brands simply connect Boom to their store, and their AI agent instantly starts selling, supporting, and following up like a real team member — no setup or flow-building required.\r\n\r\nE-commerce is a $6T market where brands spend heavily to bring customers in, only to lose over 99% of them before checkout. Boom fixes that by turning every missed conversation into a sales opportunity. Our clients increase conversion rates and deliver a concierge-like buying experience at scale. We believe that in the near future, every online store will have AI employees managing sales and customer relationships — and Boom is building the platform that makes that possible.",
