  "long_description": "At Axial Composites Industries we are building the first non-planar manufacturing cell to automate advanced thermoplastic composites production.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the following:\r\n\r\n•\tComposites are the apex material for drone-related applications\r\n•\tCarbon fiber manufacturing technology is still at its infancy\r\n\r\nOur mission is to develop novel composite manufacturing methods that will act as the foundation for the upcoming cambrian explosion in aerospace and robotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur method can produce stronger and lighter parts by leveraging fiber anisotropy to our advantage. This not only allows for shorter lead times and iteration cycles, but it unlocks new possibilities for composite manufacturing.\r\n\r\n",
