  "long_description": "At Axial Composites Industries we are building the first non-planar manufacturing cell to manufacture carbon fiber parts at the speed of software for the upcoming autonomous age\r\n\r\nWe believe in the following:\r\n\r\n•\tAerospace and robotics manufacturing is going exponential\r\n•\tThermoplastic composites will be the foundational materials for such applications\r\n\r\nOur mission is to equip the West with novel composite manufacturing methods that will act as the backbone of the skyrocketing demand in autonomous systems.\r\n\r\nOur method prints stronger and lighter parts by leveraging fiber anisotropy to our advantage. We can manufacture large composite structures in a day rather than weeks. This not only allows for faster iteration cycles, but it unlocks new possibilities for composite manufacturing.",
