  "long_description": "DiligenceSquared delivers AI-powered market due diligence for investment decisions - like the $500k McKinsey reports, but automated, auditable, and at a fraction of the cost.\r\n\r\nWhen Private Equity funds evaluate deals, they pay firms like McKinsey, BCG, and Bain $500K-$1M for market due diligence. The process takes weeks, and the output is a static PowerPoint that's impossible to audit. A single large-cap PE fund can spend >$30M annually on this and the total market is $10B per year.\r\n\r\nOur AI agents conduct expert interviews and synthesize insights with every claim linked to source transcripts. No black box, no \"trust me\" slides, and no 10x mark-up for human labor.\r\n\r\nFrederik bought these reports as a Principal at Blackstone. Soren sold them as a Principal at BCG. Harshil is a repeat founder and former Software Engineer at Google. We've seen both sides and know what matters in due diligence - and now we automate it.\r\n\r\nOur clients already include 8 leading private equity funds with over $2.4 trillion in combined AUM.",
