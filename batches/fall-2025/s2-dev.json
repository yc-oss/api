  "long_description": "S2 is a serverless datastore for real-time, streaming data.\r\n\r\nThe more we worked on data systems, the more we felt like there was a missing building block. The seamless experience of object storage simply did not exist for durable streams â€“ so we set out to fix that!\r\n\r\nS2 reimagines streams as an unlimited and access-controlled web resource. Like if Kafka and S3 had a baby.\r\n\r\n- Building agents? Use granular streams to persist context in real time, make workflows auditable, and coordinate between agents.\r\n\r\n- Publishing fast-moving data? Streams support high fanout and can be accessed directly over the internet, so they are a great fit for broadcasting real-time feeds.\r\n\r\n- Sandboxing? Emit to per-instance streams, and read history or live events just as easily.\r\n\r\n- Local-first and multiplayer experiences? Propagate updates reliably and efficiently.\r\n\r\nStop dealing with clusters, and start streaming.",
