  "long_description": "Social media has become more media and less social. When I open up Facebook and Instagram, I don’t see any of my friends on it anymore - it’s one third ads, one third content from strangers on the internet, and one third AI slop. My friends are no longer on social media - I either meet up with them IRL or catch up with them in group chats.\r\n\r\nLaunch Video\r\nhttps://youtu.be/KW2tjLl6sxM \r\n\r\nWe’re building the first AI-native social operating system where digipals (ambient ai agents that have full context over your location, calendar, group chats, photos, and relationship history with your friends) act as the atomic units of human coordination. Your digipal gets full context over who you are, when you're available, and what you like. It then talks with your friends’ digipals to suggest hangouts when everyone is free, find restaurants and coffee shops nearby, make dinner reservations using AI calls, split bills based on the receipt, and nudge posting photo memories after hanging out.\r\n\r\nBy removing the friction for human connection, we believe that AI can be used to deepen human relationships by allowing us to spend more time with friends IRL and through staying close to their life updates and memories in group chats.",
