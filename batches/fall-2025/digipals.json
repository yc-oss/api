  "long_description": "Social networks are dead. Social media became more media than social. My friends aren't on social media anymore - it's one third ads, one third content from strangers, and one third AI slop. Our social lives are fragmented across dozens of apps: WhatsApp, Instagram, Find My, Google Calendar, Splitwise. We're building Digipals: ambient AI agents that live in your group chats with full context over your location, calendar, relationships, and photos, that write code to generate custom widgets to help us build better friendships. Digipals is the first AI-native social operating system and the last social platform anyone will ever need.\r\n\r\nLaunch Video\r\nhttps://youtu.be/KW2tjLl6sxM ",
