  "long_description": "Absurd makes AI brand and performance ads at scale. Our last video for Kalshi (\"Election Day\") did 1M+ views, and we average 300K+ organic views across all videos. \r\n\r\nOur clients include Kalshi, Replit, Reforge, Gumloop, Micro1, and a couple YC and HF0 startups. \r\n\r\nWe do this with a multi-agent orchestration layer to create production-quality videos in 72 hours. These agents collaborate with your team on Slack to plan and generate every scene on an interactive canvas. From the canvas, your team can watch shot lists, image frames and video renders come to life in real time — commenting, iterating, or generating new ideas alongside the agents.\r\n\r\nTry it today at absurd.com",
