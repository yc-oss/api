  "long_description": "Absurd (YC F25) makes absurd AI launch videos. Their first launch video hit 450K+ views on X.\r\n\r\nMaking good AI videos is hard. You have to write a story that actually flows, pick the right models for motion, faces, and lighting, and then stitch it all together so it feels cinematic. Most people don’t realize how much craft that takes — so most AI ads end up looking like slop.\r\n\r\nAbsurd replaces that process with autonomous AI agents, guided by a team of creative directors, to create production-quality videos in 72 hours. These agents collaborate with your team on Slack to plan, script, and generate every scene on an interactive canvas. From the canvas, your team can watch shotlists, image frames, and video renders come to life in real time — commenting, iterating, or generating new ideas alongside the agents.\r\n\r\nTry it today at tryabsurd.com",
