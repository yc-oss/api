  "long_description": "Hypercubic is an AI-native maintenance and modernization platform for COBOL and mainframes.\r\n\r\nWe help enterprises understand and preserve their mission-critical legacy systems. About 70% of the Fortune 500 companies still rely on them to run their core business applications in banking, insurance, telecom, airlines, retail, and more.\r\n\r\nThese systems, originally built in the 1960s–90s, still power trillions in global infrastructure today but have become increasingly opaque as original developers retire or leave the workforce. \r\n\r\nWe're laying the foundation to autonomously maintain and modernize these legacy systems to future-proof the backbone of the global economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more at hypercubic.ai",
