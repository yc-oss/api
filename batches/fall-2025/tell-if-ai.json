  "long_description": "Tell If AI is a team founded by ex DeepMind and Yandex researchers focused on fighting  deepfakes and AI generated slop. We've trained our own state of the art foundation model on a massive amount of data sampled from over 70 different generative AI models. For content found in the wild, we offer high precision and recall at detecting whether that content was made or modified with AI and we can sometimes say precisely which AI model made the content. We work with image, video, and audio.\r\n\r\nTry our free demo at https://tellif.ai.",
