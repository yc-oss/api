  "long_description": "We help construction and solar contractors eliminate delays, confusion, and rework. We audit designs for code compliance before construction starts, detect clashes early, and automatically generate RFIs from drawings. We also accelerate takeoffs, estimating, and trade package alignment so preconstruction teams can move faster with fewer errors. \r\n\r\nFrom RFIs to permits to supplier updates, everything runs automatically so teams can focus on building, not waiting. \r\n\r\nWe integrate with Procore, Outlook, Gmail, Bluebeam, Autodesk, and other tools you already use. \r\n\r\nTeams use us to:\r\n- Save $3,000,000 per project\r\n- Catch design and coordination errors before they happen\r\n- Verify code and permits instantly\r\n- Align trade packages and scopes automatically\r\n- Speed up takeoffs, estimating, and procurement\r\n- Get real-time updates from every crew\r\n\r\nContact us founders@usearticulate.com to learn more!",
