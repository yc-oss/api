  "long_description": "Lemma enables AI agents to continuously improve from user feedback and production outcomes. Instead of relying on manual prompt tuning and reactive debugging, Lemma detects when an agent’s performance drifts, pinpoints the exact step causing failures, generates optimized prompt candidates, and automatically delivers improvements through our API or by opening a pull request in your codebase. \r\n\r\nBuilt by ex-AI engineers who felt this pain firsthand, Lemma turns static agents into self-improving systems, helping teams ship reliable AI products faster with compounding performance gains over time. \r\n\r\nDeploy 1x. Learn forever.",
