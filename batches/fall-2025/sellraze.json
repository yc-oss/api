  "long_description": "SellRaze is a video shopping platform that makes it easy for sellers to create engaging listings and connect with buyers.\r\n\r\nOur AI makes video creation accessible at scale. It identifies every item in a video, automatically filling in details and pricing so sellers don't have to write descriptions or research prices. Sellers showcase multiple items in a single clip while telling their stories, and buyers can purchase any item individually. The AI guides sellers while filming and auto-edits footage into polished videosâ€”turning casual sellers into content creators.\r\n\r\nVideo listings generate dramatically higher engagement and sales than photos. We're building a community where buyers discover products from the sellers they follow.\r\n",
