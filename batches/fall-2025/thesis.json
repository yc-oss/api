  "long_description": "Thesis is building the engine for discovery. Our aim is to help uncover the next AlphaFold or build the next Transformer, faster, more systematically, and at scale. We treat discovery not as a matter of luck, but as an engineering challenge to be solved.\r\n\r\nThesis lets anyone build powerful machine learning models for anything they can imagine. The mission is to democratize invention by putting machine intelligence in everyone’s hands.\r\n\r\nEvery major breakthrough in the next decade, in science, industry, or AI, will be built on systems like Thesis. \r\n\r\nWe intend to define that category.",
