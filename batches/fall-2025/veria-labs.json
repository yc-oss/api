Founded by members of the #1 US competitive hacking team, we've already manually found critical bugs in AI tools, operating systems, fintech and billion dollar crypto exchanges. \r\n\r\nNow we're scaling that expertise through AI-native security tooling that operates faster than human researchers while finding deeper, more complex vulnerabilities that traditional tools miss.",
