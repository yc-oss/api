  "long_description": "Our customers 5× prospecting efficiency by simply unlocking untapped opportunities in the most data-scarce, fragmented markets - like construction, hospitality, startups, and retail.\r\n\r\nYou might think that LinkedIn Sales Nav, Clay, ZoomInfo, or Apollo have you covered. They don’t. We’ve built an engaging prospecting app for sales reps that simply could not have existed before. ⁠Our AI can extrapolate missing information, source leads, and qualify B2B prospects at scale - especially in industries with a low digital footprint, a market far larger than what legacy databases can cover.\r\n\r\nCo-founders are Milan Stankovic (CTO) - PhD to make AI work with limited data, and Ludovic Granger (CEO). Small-to-enterprise teams in companies targeting SMBs in construction, hotels & restaurants, and retail grow with Leadbay, both in France and in the US.\r\n\r\nTry us on leadbay.ai.",
