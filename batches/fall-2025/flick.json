  "long_description": "\r\nFlick is an AI filmmaking software that lets people create Hollywood-level short films completely using AI end-to-end.\r\n\r\nThere are many AI tools that can give you 8-second casual clips to post on social media, but when it comes to creating truly high-quality films with coherent storylines, consistent characters, and cinematic aesthetics, they don’t come close due to their lack of flexibility, creative control, and fragmented creative flow.\r\n\r\nFounded by an award-winning filmmaker and a founding engineer at Instagram, Flick defines an interface specifically designed for native AI filmmaking that feels natural and enables end-to-end creative flows. Think of Flick as Figma for AI filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 complete AI short films created using Flick that got 20+ awards in international film festivals already and our early creator residency community are generating several AI short films every week.\r\n\r\nWe are also building a community where we produce our own AI films as well as collaborating with other well-known filmmakers to share their “behind-the-scenes” workflows as resuable templates to inspire users in our community. We not only build product, we also build world-class content.\r\n\r\nThe whole film industry will be revolutionized by AI and our goal is to be “the product” that defines this category.",
