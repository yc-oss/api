  "long_description": "Founded by an award-winning filmmaker and a founding engineer at Instagram, Flick challenges the norm: most AI tools are technically driven, not built from a creator’s perspective.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to build a tool designed for filmmakers, not engineers. Filmmakers shouldn’t have to worry about the technical layer — they deserve full creative control, with their taste woven into every loop of the process.\r\n\r\nWe call it Flick — a word that means both film and a quick motion. To us, it captures what creativity should feel like: light, natural, and fast, not heavy or mechanical.\r\n\r\nJust like a flick of the hand or a flicker of light, great creators break conventions and let ideas flow effortlessly, using AI not as a shortcut but as a force to amplify imagination and visual storytelling.\r\n\r\nThat’s the spirit behind everything we build.",
