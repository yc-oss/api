  "long_description": "Clicks automates your back-office using your existing tools and processes without requiring any IT integrations.\r\n\r\nWhat We Do:\r\nThink of Clicks as your back-office worker that can handle any repetitive task. Simply describe your process via video call or share documentation, and our forward-deployed engineering team ensures it's automated exactly your way.\r\nOur AI agents work 24/7 and can be kicked-off via email, Slack, or our web app, handling tasks like CRM updates, report generation, and data entry while adapting to your existing software.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus:\r\nWe're starting with recruiting and executive search firms, automating candidate codification, assessment reports, and administrative workflows that typically consume hours of manual work each day.\r\n\r\nValue Proposition:\r\nOur pricing is 100% outcome based: you only pay for the work outputs we complete (e.g., candidates added to CRM, reports generate, etc.). Current customers are already live and saving an average of 60% in costs compared to human workers, with full automation deployed within one week.",
