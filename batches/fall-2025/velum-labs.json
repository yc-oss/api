  "long_description": "Velum Labs is an open source firewall that controls access to sensitive company information. We tokenize sensitive content across text and documents to enforce policies without blocking AI or human workflows.\r\n\r\nOur firewall sits between data sources and all consumers (LLMs, users, and vendors) so every API call and integration flow through policy.\r\n\r\nVelum's policy engine understands text, tables, and media to automatically tokenize sentences, blur figures, or pseudonymize identities. Policies are defined in natural language, and are enforced per user, role, and purpose to ensure minimal exposure.\r\n\r\nVelum integrates directly with LLMs, SaaS platforms, and data warehouses, enforcing privacy across AI agents and enterprise workflows.",
