Employees get concierge care they love.\r\n\r\nOur AI-enabled virtual care treats common conditions over text or video. For in-person care, our AI agents search across all in-network providers using millions of price and quality data points, recommend the best options, then coordinate scheduling. Employees get rewarded for choosing high-value care through copay reimbursements.\r\n\r\nWe've already contracted to roll out to thousands of employees across multiple employers for the 2025-2026 plan year.\r\n\r\nWe're on a mission to build member-aligned, AI-native health insurance, starting with cost containment.",
