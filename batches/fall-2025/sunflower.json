  "long_description": "Sunflower is on a mission to create one trillion days sober. Our product is both a consumer app (think a \"Duolingo for addiction\") but also with a tele-therapy clinic inside. \r\n\r\nConsumer App: \r\n- We built the #1 AI Sponsor for any kind of addiction\r\n- Beautiful visual progression tracking to power the core \"task to be done\" of addiction\r\n- A twitter style social media for addicts \r\n- DIY learn content (think Masterclass for addiction) for all major addiction types \r\n- CBT based journaling exercises \r\n\r\nTele-Therapy: \r\n- Think a \"Early Medical Peter Attia\" quality of clinic, but completely focused on addiction \r\n- Starting with talk therapy in CA & TX we're rolling out to all 50 states + MAT \r\n- Bringing together the worlds best doctors to create the most effective protocol for addiction \r\n\r\nSunflower went from 0 - 100k MAU in less than 6 months, and now we're continuing the traction to create the #1 product for addiction for the 1.2B humans on this planet that struggle with this fundamental human problem.
