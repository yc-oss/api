  "long_description": "Pixley is revolutionizing early education. No more passive learning: lectures, worksheets, deskwork. Kids don’t just watch content – they create it. With Pixley, any drawing or picture becomes an animated character, and every episode is shaped by the child’s imagination.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, parents have complete control over what their kids learn. They choose the academic or moral lesson each story teaches, making screen time both safe and educational. For the first time, children and parents have complete control of the media they consume.\r\n\r\nWe’re harnessing brand-new video gen technology that’s set to revolutionize how the world creates and learns. Generating animated, narrative-consistent content from a child’s input in real time demands breakthroughs in generative AI, safety, and personalization – and Pixley has cracked it.\r\n\r\nThe market opportunity is massive. Families already spend billions on streaming and educational media, but the content is one-size-fits-all. By giving kids a true voice in what they watch, while giving parents control, Pixley makes early education personal, fun, and effective.\r\n\r\nWe are college dropouts that have been building together for years, winning several hackathons and working with video gen along the way. We built Pixley after we saw the flood of low-quality, algorithmic AI content and knew that kids and parents deserved better.  ",
