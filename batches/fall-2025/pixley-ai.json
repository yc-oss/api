  "long_description": "Pixley is the first platform where kids can turn their drawings and ideas into fully animated cartoons in minutes. In just 3 weeks after launch, over 1000 families across 75 countries have already started creating stories.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting with a clear wedge: personalized kids’ entertainment. Parents are tired of overstimulating, low-value content from YouTube and Netflix. Pixley gives them safe and personalized stories that encourage learning and imagination.\r\n\r\nBut kids’ cartoons are just the beginning. As video generation improves, all video content will shift from manual production to being personalized and generated. Our long-term goal is to build the AI Netflix: a platform where shows and movies aren’t recommended, but instead generated around each viewer’s interests and habits.\r\n\r\nWe’re 19 year old CS dropouts who’ve known each other since elementary school and won 4 hackathons at 15. After seeing AI flood the internet with low-quality content, we created Pixley – a safe, personalized way for kids to turn their ideas into animated stories.",
