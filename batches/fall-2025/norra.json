  "long_description": "Nursing facilities are bleeding money and staff time due to operational chaos. They have zero visibility into their equipment and operations, leading to over-purchasing, equipment failures, and nurses spending hours hunting for things instead of caring for patients.\r\n\r\nNorra creates a real-time view of everything happening in the facility. We use AI and autonomous tracking to transform operational chaos into proactive decision-making. Instead of reacting to equipment failures or over-purchasing because they can't find what they own, facilities get actionable insights that prevent waste before it happens.",
