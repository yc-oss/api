  "long_description": "Miniswap a marketplace for the $1B+ tabletop miniatures market, starting with Warhammer.\r\n\r\nIn hobbies as complex as Warhammer, finding minis on general marketplaces is a huge pain. Filters don't work, free-form listings mean that products are regularly misidentified, and piles of counterfeit junk crowd search results. \r\n\r\nMiniswap saves hobbyists from this chaos with its catalogue of more than 8000 data-enriched SKUs. Sellers match their listings against Miniswap's catalogue giving buyers more information and structure as they shop.\r\n\r\nThe global market for tabletop games is estimated to be worth $10B+ in 2025 and Warhammer alone is projected to grow to $3B by 2030. By capturing the market in this untapped niche, Miniswap is strongly positioned to expand its wedge into adjacent categories, bringing greater transparency, simplicity, and connectivity into additional tabletop games and collectibles verticals.\r\n\r\nMiniswap's founding team merges deep domain knowledge with elite programming expertise and years of experience in business consulting and startups. Co-founders Zak and Will met while studying together at Cambridge, bonded over their love of Warhammer, and have been best friends ever since. ",
