  "long_description": "Logical is a desktop AI that acts as a proactive and largely promptless copilot, designed to reduce the friction of using AI for everyday tasks. It transfers context across apps, and allows taking action on many apps with just a few clicks. Logical can assist with drafting emails, writing docs, noting meetings and can even automatically detect action items. Need to prompt? Logical can understand intent in much fewer words than a regular chatbot. Plus, user data is never sent to Logical servers. Logical is the AI resurrection of Clippy, but actually good.",
