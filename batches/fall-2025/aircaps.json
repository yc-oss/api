  "long_description": "AirCaps is bringing AI assistance to real-world conversations. \r\n\r\nOur software provides live captions, translations, and proactive AI insights for meetings in your field of view on lightweight AR glasses.\r\n\r\nWe started by helping people with hearing loss understand speech with real-world captions, then expanded to breaking down language barriers with live translation, and now provide AI support during important meetings for professionals.\r\n\r\nWe’ve already transcribed 15,000 hours of in-person conversations and counting. Today, AirCaps assists with 11% of our users’ in-person conversations.\r\n\r\nWe did $93K in revenue in October and grew 6.5x from September while spending <$3K on marketing. Our power users average 6h+ daily usage and our day-30 retention is 91%.\r\n\r\nWe previously went viral (75M+ views on TikTok, 150K+ followers) and have been featured by The New Yorker, WIRED, and Forbes.\r\n\r\nWe’re building intelligence for the 200 billion daily conversations that happen face-to-face. \r\n\r\nMadhav (CEO, Yale CS) has been building on smart glasses since age 13, starting with Google Glass apps. He researched audio AI at the MIT Media Lab. Nirbhay (CTO, Cornell CS) built voice AI on smart glasses in high school and built conversational AI products as the first engineer at 2 YC startups.",
