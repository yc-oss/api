  "long_description": "Semiotic is an AI‑native design firm built to deliver human‑quality work at a significantly higher speed and scale than traditional design agencies. \r\n\r\nWe’re starting with landing pages for fast‑growing startups. AI website builders didn't make creating websites easier—they made creating ugly websites easier. So, companies choose between blue-purple gradient slop or firms with 3-month waitlists and $100k minimums.\r\n\r\nWe’re building taste at scale to solve both. Our AI agents span art direction, design research, and execution—so you iterate at the pace of your ambition.\r\n\r\nStart a project: semiotic.so",
