  "long_description": "Parrot is the TikTok for language learning. We turn doomscrolling into fluency with personalized short-form video lessons backed by Stephen Krashen’s comprehensible input theory. In under 4 months, we’ve scaled to $220K ARR with an average LTV:CAC of 5.5, and power users averaging 35+ mins/day on Parrot. Our team of engineers, designers, and growth leaders have lived the frustration of ineffective apps and learning methods - we’re building the first language platform that actually works.",
