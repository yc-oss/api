  "long_description": "AI systems now run on complex chains of models, agents, and APIs, yet most teams still lack visibility into where their tokens, time, or compute go.\r\n\r\nNivara gives engineering and finance teams full transparency into AI model and agent usage. Nivara tracks every LLM and agent call, across users, sessions, and workflows, to reveal real spend insights.\r\n\r\nTeams use Nivara to see which agents or models drive the most spend, what each user session costs, and how to optimize prompts or caching to save budget without hurting quality.\r\n\r\nBy unifying token analytics, agent observability, and AI FinOps, Nivara helps teams manage AI usage responsibly, efficiently, and predictably, from startups experimenting with AI features to enterprises orchestrating thousands of agents.\r\n\r\nNivara â€” Know where your AI dollars go.",
