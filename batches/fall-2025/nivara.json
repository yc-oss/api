  "long_description": "AI is now woven into every workflow. Engineers use Copilot, Cursor, and Claude, marketers use ChatGPT, analysts use Gemini, yet most companies still have no visibility into how it improves outcomes and drives impact.\r\n\r\nNivara gives organizations the intelligence to measure, improve, and scale AI adoption. We connect to tools like GitHub, Jira, Copilot, and Claude to show how AI impacts delivery speed and quality, then use a real-time in-work coach to help teams use AI more effectively inside their daily tools. \r\n\r\nBy combining AI usage intelligence, productivity insights, and adaptive coaching, Nivara helps companies close the loop between AI strategy and execution, driving measurable productivity gains across every function.\r\n\r\nEmpower every team to work intelligently with AI.",
