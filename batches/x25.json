It learns from your codebase's patterns, points out bugs, suggesting fixes, and frees you from low-level review tasks.\r\n- You then jump into the mrge platform, which is designed to optimize how humans review code. For example, file changes are organized in a logical order instead of alphabetical, and mrge generates diagrams of architecture changes.",
