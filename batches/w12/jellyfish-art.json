  "long_description": "Jellyfish Art makes jellyfish aquariums and supplies them with live jellyfish and accessories. Jellyfish are a new trend in personal aquariums. They require specialized tanks with water flow patterns that keep the jellyfish suspended in the middle of the tank away from filtration intakes. They also require specialized food made from frozen plankton. Jellyfish Art sells everything needed to keep jellyfish in a personal aquarium, including the live jellyfish, which can be shipped anywhere in the U.S. via overnight express delivery.\n\nThe company sells all of its products through its website and ships from a warehouse located in San Francisco, CA. It is the flagship site of AnyVivo.",
