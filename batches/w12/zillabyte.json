  "long_description": "Zillabyte is a cloud platform for data analysis.  Build apps, not infrastructure. \n\n\nWe set up and maintain the infrastructure you need to analyze your data. All you need to do is develop your app locally and test it using the our CLI. When you need to scale, push to our servers. \n\nEasily add more functionality with components, modular code blocks that let you perform additional functions such as: geo coding, fraud analysis, and web scraping.\n\nUse your own private datasets or plug into our off-the-shelf data, which includes a copy of the web. You can even combine the two and extract rich insights.",
