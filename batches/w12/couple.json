  "long_description": "TenthBit Inc. was founded in 2012, in sunny California. The founders, having been disconnected from their significant others while being a part of the YC program, found that they were repurposing many other services to talk to their partners. After many frustrating skype calls, and international text messages, they decided to build Couple. The app now has over two million downloads on iOS and Android and has helped couples send over a billion messages to each other.",
