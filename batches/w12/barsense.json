The child will be unable to leave the app to access the rest of the Android phone’s features. Parents have full control over the applications from the browser and can also track the phone’s GPS online.\n\nIt has other features that enable parents to turn off SMS and Facebook during school hours, ban apps and games during school and bed time hours, monitor internet usage, prevent the usage of third party browsers, set time limits on games, check call history, track location in real-time, receive email reports about what their child has been doing, and full remote control from their phone, tablet or PC.",
