  "long_description": "At Verse Therapy, we're dedicated to making quality speech therapy accessible for everyone by empowering speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to launch and grow their own independent practices. We help therapists focus on what they do best—providing compassionate, personalized care—by taking care of the administrative tasks that often lead to burnout. Through thoughtful marketing and partnerships with care organizations like rehab centers, we connect SLPs with individuals who need their expertise. Our AI-enabled back office streamlines insurance processing, scheduling, and documentation, reducing non-therapy overhead. We're now live in 10 states with over 35 dedicated therapists and are in-network with leading insurance providers, making it easier for clients to receive the support they need.",
