  "long_description": "Pythagora is an open source tool that builds apps from scratch by talking to users. It uses LLMs to automate developer workflows (debugging, refactoring, etc.) and ask user questions whenever it needs feedback.\r\n\r\nIt is an IDE extension built on top of our open-source tool, GPT Pilot, which has over 22k Github stars.\r\n\r\nYou start by describing an app you want to build; then, it asks you questions about the details of the app to write the full app specifications. Once the specs are done, it starts coding. When it finishes a task, it asks you to test the app and tell it if something is incorrect. It iterates with you by changing the code and asking you for feedback until the task is finished. Finally, it commits the code it has written and proceeds to the next task until the entire app is finished.\r\n",
