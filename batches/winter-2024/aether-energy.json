  "long_description": "Aether is an AI-powered end-to-end platform for rooftop solar and roofing installers in the US and Western European markets. \r\n\r\nSome of our innovations:\r\n\r\n- In-house computer vision and fine-tuned AI models built for solar\r\n- Rapid and accurate photovoltaic site design, 10x faster\r\n- Co-pilot for rooftop solar to streamline & automate various tasks for solar installers. \r\n\r\nWhy itâ€™s needed: Today, rooftop solar is still complex, expensive, and inaccurate. More than half of the cost of a rooftop solar project comes from soft costs. We started Aether with the sole aim of reducing solar soft costs. \r\n\r\nOur vision: Aether will be a big player in the young and emerging Solar software vertical, which has a projected 20B Global TAM up for grabs by 2025.",
