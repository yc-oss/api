  "long_description": "Superagent identifies catastrophic failures in AI systems before they reach customers or regulators.\r\n\r\nWe run a fully managed test service that maps where your models, agents, and workflows can cause legal, security, or customer harm, then build and execute targeted test suites around those risks. The tests cover security, compliance, and product-critical failure modes, and produce structured, audit-ready evidence that enterprise buyers require.\r\n\r\nMost customers use Superagent to prove their AI products are safe to deploy and to maintain that assurance as the systems evolve.",
