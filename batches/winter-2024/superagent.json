  "long_description": "Superagent makes AI products safe and compliant.\r\n\r\nWe provide defense models and adversarial tests that prevent safety and compliance failures in AI agents and give companies the proof they need for enterprise deals. \r\n\r\nOur small language models, Guard, Redact, and Verify, run inside agents to stop prompt injections, data leaks, and unsafe outputs. Our tests measure prompt resistance, data protection, and factual accuracy so teams know how their system behaves under pressure.",
