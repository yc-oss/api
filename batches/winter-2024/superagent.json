  "long_description": "Superagent builds infrastructure for running and embedding AI coding agents in real workflows — safely, flexibly, and with full control.\r\n\r\nOur latest open-source release is VibeKit, a CLI wrapper for coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex. It runs agent-generated code in isolated Docker containers, redacts secrets automatically, and streams output in real-time. No cloud signup required — works locally by default.\r\n\r\nVibeKit lets developers swap models behind any agent CLI, see exactly what agents do (not just text output), and run agents without affecting their local environment. Teams use it to meet compliance requirements while giving developers the tools they actually want to use.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://www.vibekit.sh/",
