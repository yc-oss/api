  "long_description": "Superagent is the defense layer for AI agents. It inspects every prompt, response, and tool call at runtime to block prompt injections, data leaks, and backdoors in generated code before they reach production.\r\n\r\nAt the core is SuperagentLM, a small language model trained specifically for agentic security. Unlike rules or filters, it uses reasoning to catch subtle and novel attacks. It’s lightweight and fast — optimized to run inline on CPU or GPU without slowing down your stack.\r\n\r\nSuperagent integrates at the API layer, inside agent frameworks, and in CI/CD pipelines, with a single dashboard for policies, audit logs, and runtime visibility. This gives teams real-time protection and compliance guardrails without slowing down AI adoption.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://www.superagent.sh/",
