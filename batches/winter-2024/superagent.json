  "long_description": "Superagent is the world’s first firewall purpose-built for AI systems. It protects your models and data at runtime by inspecting every prompt and response. It blocks prompt injections, jailbreaks, and data leaks, prevents backdoors in generated code, and quarantines suspicious outputs. \r\n\r\nThe firewall is powered by a small language model fine-tuned for security and safety. Unlike static rules or regex filters, it can reason about context to catch subtle attacks and leaks. The model is lightweight and optimized for speed — fast enough to run inline with every request and response without slowing down your apps.\r\n\r\nSuperagent also provides observability with full traces, audit logs, and policy enforcement, giving teams security and control without slowing down AI adoption.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://www.superagent.sh/",
