  "long_description": "Pythagora is the world's first all-in-one AI development platform, which can help you get from idea to production-ready app by talking to users. It uses LLMs to automate developer workflows (debugging, refactoring, etc.) and ask user questions whenever it needs feedback.\r\n\r\nIt is an IDE extension built on top of our open-source tool, GPT Pilot, which has over 32k Github stars.\r\n\r\nYou start with an idea and a simple prompt. In minutes, Pythagora builds you the full app specifications. Once the specs are done, it starts building the frontend. After your app's UI is polished, you can build the backend. It iterates with you by changing the code and asking you for feedback until the app is finished. When done, you can securely deploy and share your app.\r\n",
