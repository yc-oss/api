  "long_description": "At Arini, we’re building the operating system for dental groups. Phones are the backbone of dental operations — 80% of appointments are still booked over the phone — yet practices miss 20–30% of inbound calls. That’s millions in lost revenue every month.\r\n\r\nPatient engagement is the biggest bottleneck to growth in dentistry, and we’ve built the most comprehensive AI-powered patient engagement suite in the industry. Arini manages calls, texts, and bookings.\r\n\r\nWe’re going after a $220B, overlooked industry that still runs on legacy systems and outdated workflows. Arini is bringing AI to every part of the dental stack.",
