  "long_description": "Clarion is building the most advanced AI communication layer for healthcare. Our AI agents handle the overwhelming volume of calls and messages that clinics face daily—from scheduling to billing to prescription refills—freeing staff to focus on patient care. We're an in-person company based in New York.\r\n\r\nToday, clinics miss 30-40% of inbound calls due to staffing shortages. We're solving this by automating complex workflows end-to-end, already serving tens of thousands of patients monthly across virtual care companies, health systems, and a $5B health insurance company.\r\n\r\nWe've raised $5.4M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout), and healthcare founders from Ophelia, Medallion, and Counsel Health. \r\n\r\nOur founders bring both clinical and technical expertise—our CEO Ryan is a Stanford/Harvard-trained physician who was on the founding teams of Two Chairs and Ophelia, while our CTO Jeffrey built voice AI at Amazon Alexa and led AI/ML teams at Salesforce.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we transform healthcare communication—creating a future where patients get faster resolutions and providers reclaim time for what matters most.",
