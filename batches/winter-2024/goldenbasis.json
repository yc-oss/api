  "long_description": "GoldenBasis makes modern back-office software for brokerages like Schwab or Fidelity, and weâ€™re starting with asset transfers. Every year, $1.1 trillion in assets are transferred between brokerages using decades-old software. Brokerages hire thousands of people to compensate but still lose revenue from abandoned transfers. We solve this problem by automating back-office workflows with AI.",
