  "long_description": "Dropback is building front office software for the future of college sports. We help major athletic departments manage their teams' \"salary caps\" and roster limits to construct their most competitive rosters.\r\n\r\nJust two years ago, it became legal for athletes to earn an income beyond their scholarships. Since then, despite college athletes earning $2B+, rapid regulation change has put college sports in disarray. Dropback brings order to this chaos through custom compensation frameworks, roster management, what-if playgrounds, and more--ultimately helping elite programs optimize spend & maximize talent.",
