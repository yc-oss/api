  "long_description": "At Dime, we automate repetitive administrative work in healthcare clinics, including insurance coordination, referrals, referring-provider communication, scheduling, and patient communication. \r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with RIS and EHR systems, creating true end-to-end automation rather than adding another software layer. Our HIPAA-compliant AI agents eliminate paperwork bottlenecks, reduce errors, and restore hours of clinical time - enabling care teams to focus on patients.",
