  "long_description": "We created Ruby, an AI Product designer who improves your product while you sleep.\r\n\r\nYou can assign Ruby design tasks right in slack, like optimizing a flow or creating a new page.\r\nShe clarifies requirements, researches, designs multiple options, iterates with you, and ships PRs to your codebase. She will then monitor performance and suggest future improvements.\r\n\r\nSheâ€™s like Devin, but for Product Design work.",
