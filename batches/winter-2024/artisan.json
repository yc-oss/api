  "long_description": "At Artisan, we’re building real AI employees - not copilots, not assistants, but autonomous teammates.\r\n\r\nOur first, Ava, is an AI BDR. She finds and researches leads, writes emails in customers’ tone of voice, runs outbound sequences, self-optimizes, and manages email deliverability infrastructure. She learns, adapts, and improves over time - just like a human would.\r\n\r\nHuman team members use Artisan as their primary working platform, replacing a sprawling stack of sales tools, and have Artisans working alongside them.\r\n\r\nWe went through Y Combinator (W24) and have raised $35M+ from top investors. We’re at $6M+ ARR, with hundreds of customers including Remote, Quora, and SumUp.\r\n\r\nWe’re currently working on Ava 2.0, pushing the boundaries of what an AI employee can do. And we're hiring.",
