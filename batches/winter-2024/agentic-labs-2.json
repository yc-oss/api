  "long_description": "Agentic Labs is making software design and architecture less painful by building AI into the process. Today, developers have no shortage of tools for instantly creating chunks of code, but designing the systems that integrate this code is the hardest and most manual part of software engineering.\r\n\r\nOur first product is Glide, an AI-first editor purpose-built for writing technical design docs. It connects to your codebase and saves your engineering team time on triage, planning, and implementation of complex code changes.",
