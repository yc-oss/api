  "long_description": "At Omni, we’re rebuilding how banks and fintechs lend to small businesses.\r\n\r\nThere are 34 million small businesses in the U.S., yet getting a loan still means weeks of emails, PDFs, and paperwork. Every deal starts with a pile of documents — tax returns, bank statements, corporate filings, and contracts that no one wants to read but everyone depends on. \r\n\r\nOmni is changing that. We work directly with lenders to modernize the entire stack, from document intake to underwriting, and we’re doing it with a small, fast-moving team that ships real systems used in production every day.",
