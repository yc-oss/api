  "long_description": "We are Same (YC W24). We want to help people easy develop and run products.\r\n\r\nWe believe that soon everyone will be able to freely explore, create, and implement various ideas without being restricted by technology and time. Coding in its current form is still too complicated for most people. It gives control to a small elite, takes years to master, and remains unintuitive and time-consuming to the average person.\r\n\r\nWe spent the last two years building tools like Million.js and React Scan that extend what millions of developers could create. Now, we're going to share that magic with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWe're based in San Francisco and Shanghai.",
