  "long_description": "Navier AI is building the first Agent-Driven Engineering platform.\r\n\r\nWe believe engineers should focus on designing great products, not wrestling with simulation software.\r\n\r\nNavier AI makes it simple to run CFD simulations at scale through our web-based platform built on OpenFOAM, the industry-standard solver for CFD. Our AI agents autonomously handle the complex, time-consuming steps of simulation—from geometry cleanup and meshing to solver configuration and cloud resource management.\r\n\r\nBy automating the tedious parts of the workflow, we enable engineering teams to move faster, explore more design possibilities, and spend their time on high-value engineering decisions.",
