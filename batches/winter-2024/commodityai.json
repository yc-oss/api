  "long_description": "CommodityAI builds intelligent automation agents for some of the most operationally complex businesses in the world: physical commodity traders.\r\n\r\nIn trading operations, critical data is often buried in spreadsheets, emails, PDFs, and legacy systems — making workflows slow, error-prone, and overly manual. CommodityAI acts as a digital operator, continuously reading, interpreting, and updating information across the trade lifecycle to keep records accurate and systems in sync.\r\n\r\nOur agents extract and validate key details from trade confirmations, contracts, vessel updates, and more — turning scattered, unstructured data into clean, structured records that flow directly into CTRMs, ERPs, and other core platforms. No manual entry required.\r\n\r\nBy automating what others still do by hand, we help trading teams move faster, reduce risk, and focus on the decisions that matter most.",
