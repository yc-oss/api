Zac did CS and AI Research, and Lucious built his first $1M ARR product while moonlighting at a YC startup at age 19..\r\n\r\nUberEats and DoorDash have become cluttered and impersonal super apps. They've created a $30B opportunity for a delivery app that puts the customer experience first by combining high-quality videos, recommendations, and social proof from your most trusted food critics - your friends.",
