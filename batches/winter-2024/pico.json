  "long_description": "Screenshots are the fastest way to save something on your phone. Millions of people habitually screenshot things they like or might revisit - even if they never do. It's like throwing a pass to your future self that you aren't going to catch. Pico knows that your plane ticket and hotel listing are for the same trip, to grab the link for that headline so you can read it later, or to find that product online so you can buy it.",
