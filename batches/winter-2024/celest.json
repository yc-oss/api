  "long_description": "Celest is a backend-as-a-service for Flutter and Dart developers. It empowers Flutter developers with the tools and capabilities they need to become full-stack developers. We are introducing \"Cloud Widgets\", a set of primitives which enable you to declaratively define every piece of your backend and infrastructure in Dart.\r\n\r\nAs the role of the front-end developer evolves towards full-stack proficiency, we recognize that existing tools have fallen short for those specializing in Flutter. Using the programming language and patterns Flutter developers already know from building their frontend, Celest enables developers to build and connect their apps to their backend with no additional tooling.\r\n\r\nWe enable Flutter developers to concentrate on building features and delivering value to their customers rather than learning additional domains and fragmenting themselves across disparate toolchains.",
