  "long_description": "OneGrep is a DevOps Agent that helps engineers automate manual devops tasks. It works across integrations that teams have to search, correlate, and operate automated tasks like runbook automation during incidents.\r\n\r\nOneGrep specializes across devops tools to help teams release code faster and more reliably so that engineers can spend more time building rather than being trained in bespoke tools like Observability, Ci/Cd, or Infra.\r\n    \r\nAchintya and Brian are technical co-founders who have deep domain expertise in building and operating systems at scale at Coinbase, Disney, and Amazon. Achintya led the Search Team at Disney enabling DisneyPlus to scale to 70M users in two weeks. Brian was a founding engineer on the team that built the Incident Management Platform at Amazon that helps 30k DAUs in Amazon resolve critical incidents every day.\r\n    \r\nhttps://www.onegrep.dev",
