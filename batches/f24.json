We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\r\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\r\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.

This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\r\n--\r\n\r\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows.

In the long run, we will capture 50% of the corporate transaction market with the top 30 law firms. We will then provide our AI to companies so they can execute these transactions themselves.",
