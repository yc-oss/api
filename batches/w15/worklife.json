  "long_description": "WorkLife is a web app that helps teams have more productive meetings. There are over 3 Billion meetings/year in the U.S. and studies show 50% of that time is completely wasted. WorkLife helps you reclaim that time by helping you and your team adopt good meeting habits - create agendas, stay on track during the meeting, and ensure next steps get done afterwards.\n\nMost people spend the majority of their waking hours at work, and way too many of those hours in unproductive meetings. Your work life is a big portion of your life -- and the happier and more productive you are at work, the more fulfilled and energized you are in your life. Better Work = Better Life.",
