  "long_description": "Forty million men in the US and over 500 million worldwide suffer from urinary obstruction related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The majority of men will experience symptoms of this disease at some point in life. BPH, also known as prostate enlargement, leads to urinary straining, frequency, urgency, and sleep disruption. Despite the high prevalence and significant quality of life burden of BPH, established treatments are limited to drugs, which have limited effectiveness, and surgery, which carries a high risk of sexual side effects. The Zenflow Spring is a small implant delivered in the urologist's office in a simple procedure that provides quick and long-lasting symptom relief.",
