  "long_description": "At Lully, we’re building the children’s sleep company. We create innovative, thoughtfully-designed, clinically-proven consumer products to help children, and their families, sleep better. \r\n\r\nOur first product, The Sleep Guardian is the only solution for night terrors. Based on our patented, clinically-proven technology, the Sleep Guardian goes under the mattress and uses precisely-timed vibrations to avoid night terror episodes completely. \r\n\r\nThe Sleep Guardian is just the initial product in a suite of smart solutions based on our process: combining a user-centric approach with a clinical understanding of sleep to solve unmet problems in children’s sleep. \r\n\r\nBased in San Francisco, Lully was founded by Dr. Andy Rink, a doctor and father, and Varun Boriah, a medical device entrepreneur. \r\n\r\nLully was spun out of the Stanford Biodesign Fellowship and is backed by Y Combinator, Two Sigma Ventures, Stanford-StartX Fund and Highway1. We’ve partnered with Stanford Sleep and Riley Children’s Hospital in our goal to help families sleep better.",
