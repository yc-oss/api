  "long_description": "Our mission is to build a sustainable democracy for the Information Age. We create censorship resistant, free and open source software that can deploy democracies anywhere there's an internet connection. We have implemented governance infrastructure for crypto networks; shadow referendums for activists in critical countries and the first Quadratic Voting implementation in the USA for the Colorado Legislative House.\r\n\r\nBacked by Templeton Foundation (2019), Y Combinator (2015) and Fast Forward (2016). Presented on TED Global (2014). Awarded by MIT Technology Review (2017) and Singularity University (2016). We did research for Alphabet, World Economic Forum and the University of Berkeley.",
