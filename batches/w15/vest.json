Backed by private equity, the firm has a strategic partnership with Cboe Global Markets, Inc.

Today, Target Outcome Investments are available as mutualâ€¯funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), unit investment trusts (UITs), collective investment trusts (CITs), and customizable managed accounts / sub-advisory services. \r\n\r\nThe firm was launched and backed by preeminent venture firms such as Y-Combinator (Airbnb, Reddit, Dropbox), Payment Ventures (MicroVentures, CardFlight) and First Round Capital (Uber, Mint, Square).\r\n\r\nSee more at https://www.vestfin.com.",
