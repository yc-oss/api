  "long_description": "Whyd is a free social music platform designed for music lovers to keep, play, and share all of the internet's music.\n\nIt is the missing link between places where people post music to stream, like YouTube and Soundcloud, and the places where people share music, like Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nThe internet is the biggest source of music ever. There are billions of songs available to stream for free. But the music landscape is fragmented, between the multitude of different platforms where people post music, and the places where people share and talk about music. They believe that music lovers need their own platform, that serves as a tool to organize and listen to the web, and a social network that is seamlessly integrated into the listening and curation experience.",
