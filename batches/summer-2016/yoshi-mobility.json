  "long_description": "We believe that the automotive industry will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 50. The gas station was invented in 1910 and has not changed substantially since then; traditional lube and mechanic shops have not evolved much either.\r\n\r\nTo enable this industry transformation, the infrastructure required to fuel and service vehicles must evolve as well. Since the total spend for all fuel and maintenance can more than double the cost of ownership of a vehicle over its lifetime, the impact at stake is huge.\r\n\r\nThis is where we derived our mission: To help our members to keep moving in the safest, most efficient, and planet-friendly way possible, while delivering unparalleled customer service.\r\n\r\nStart Yoshi. Keep Moving.",
