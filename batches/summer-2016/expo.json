  "long_description": "Expo lets developers write apps that are written in JavaScript and run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Our cloud services that work with all Expo and React Native apps, named Expo Application Services (EAS), further speeds up teams by helping them get to the app stores as fast as possible and continue growing.\r\n\r\nWe believe that mobile apps provide a better experience than websites, but making apps is much more difficult than it needs to be. With Expo, we're bringing together the best of the web, like its development speed, fast iteration cycles, easy deploys, and automatic cross-platform support, and the performance, device capabilities, and user experience of native apps.",
