  "long_description": "Curo enables electric vehicle fleets to lease EV chargers. We do this by providing a standardized process so that any EV charger owner can host a fleet, such as an office building overnight when their employees go home.\r\n\r\nOwners of EV chargers get <15% usage after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to install, and fleets are rapidly trying to electrify yet charging is a huge bottleneck. Curo increases revenue 5x for charger owners and enables fleets to electrify instantly, at a fraction of the cost. \r\n\r\nWe're live across 5 states, having grown 50% MoM for the past 6 months. Curo is already backed by investors like Blue Bear, Not Boring, Slow and Eniac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
