  "long_description": "HYBRD helps you get stronger and faster. It pulls in all your training data, from every wearable and workout tracking app you use, and uses it to personalize training plans specifically to you and your goals\r\n\r\nExisting products tend to focus on only one type of exercise (either cardio or strength), leaving hybrid athletes juggling disconnected tools. As hybrid athletes themselves the founders found this frustrating and set out to build the unified approach they needed for their training.\r\n\r\nThree of HYBRD’s founders previously worked at WHOOP, each leading teams across product, growth and analytics. Ruiters, the CTO, was a senior tech lead at AWS. In parallel, Mats was a member of the US national rowing team and Ben, Shoe and Ruiters have all completed Ironman 70.3s. The team's VP of tech/founding engineer Michael rowed at Cornell and is ex-WHOOP as well. \r\n",
