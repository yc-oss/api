  "long_description": "HYBRD is the performance hub for modern athletes. It brings all your training data together by integrating with top wearables and uses AI to make tracking weightlifting easy. This allows athletes to fully understand their training load, track holistic progress over time, and compete with friends in fresh, exciting ways.\r\n\r\nExisting products tend to focus on only one type of exercise (either cardio or strength), leaving hybrid athletes juggling disconnected tools. As hybrid athletes themselves the founders found this frustrating and set out to build the unified approach they needed for their training.\r\n\r\nThree of HYBRDâ€™s founders previously worked at WHOOP, each leading teams across product, growth and analytics. Ruiters, the CTO, was a senior tech lead at AWS. In parallel, Mats was a member of the US national rowing team and Ben, Shoe and Ruiters have all completed Ironman 70.3s.",
