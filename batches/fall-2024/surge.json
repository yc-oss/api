  "long_description": "Surge is Stripe for telephony. Our team has experience building telephony software at billion dollar scale. Because of increased regulation, Twilio and other SMS APIs take weeks to onboard new customers, but we can get startups onboarded same day. Surge wins by enabling easy carrier registration, better support, and higher level APIs and no code UI components to make implementation easier for startups and developers.",
