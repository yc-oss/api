  "long_description": "Bramble is a video-first search platform for real estate, powered by AI. It helps agents auto-generate beautiful video listings and helps buyers search them for what they actually care about, like natural light or a big yard.\r\n\r\nWe launched as a flat-rate real estate brokerage. After helping customers close on $10M worth of homes, we learned that lead generation is the biggest problem in real estate. By helping agents market their listings with videos and allowing buyers to find homes visually, we'll build a next-generation Zillow.",
