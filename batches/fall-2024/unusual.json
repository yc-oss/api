  "long_description": "Unusual helps brands discover and change how AI models talk about them.\r\n\r\nUnusual surveys models with thousands of targeted probing questions to understand how they form their opinions. We examine the sources they pull from, and find patterns in their reasoning, that let us create content and PR engineered to change those models’ minds.\r\n\r\nA typical Unusual customer sees more than a 40% increase in traffic from AI models within a month of going live.\r\n\r\nBeyond driving more traffic, customers have used Unusual to shift models’ perception of their brand from “niche” to “enterprise-platform”, from “scrappy” to “customer-obsessed”, and from “good for startups” to “a solid bet for the middle market”.\r\n\r\nWe work with top companies including Reducto, Monarch Money, and more.",
