  "long_description": "Praxis AI builds manufacturing specific agents capable of reasoning and processing complex situations. Our engineering copilot predicts and prevents machine failures in real time by solving problems the same way an engineer would.\r\n\r\nOur agents have access to and make sense of the structured and unstructured data that exists at factories including machine sensor data, maintenance manuals and work orders. Our simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal AI knowledge to create custom complex workflows on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts. We know that dashboards don't cut costs, actions do.",
