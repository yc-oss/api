  "long_description": "ArchiLabs is building an AI co-pilot for architecture. Instead of spending hours on tedious tasks, architects can 10x their design speed with simple AI prompts.\r\n\r\nBrian and William met at Carnegie Mellon as engineers and separately had their own frustrating new construction experiences. Brian ran a tech-enabled homebuilding factory and found the design iteration process to be a massive bottleneck, while William built ground up homes in Texas and had a similar frustration. However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.\r\n\r\nAs AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.",
