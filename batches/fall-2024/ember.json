  "long_description": "At Ember, we're tackling one of healthcare's most costly and overlooked challenges: the massive inefficiency in clinical documentation and revenue cycle management. Medical practices lose billions annually due to incomplete documentation, missed billing opportunities, and denied claims - issues that stem from antiquated systems that force clinicians to choose between patient care and paperwork. We combine ambient listening technology with deep understanding of medical billing requirements to eliminate the administrative burden that plagues healthcare providers.",
