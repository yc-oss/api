  "long_description": "Riveter is bringing the power of Perplexity to the scale of the spreadsheet. Their AI agents, custom scrapers, and integrations pack the power of browser use and automation for search, at a cost that allows for scale. \r\n\r\nMost teams still spend hours (or hire UpWorkers/contractors) to manually copy product specs, check competitor pricing, pull custom KYB/KYC data to assess customer risk, or scrape filings. \r\n\r\nPerplexity and ChatGPT are great for single questions, but they can’t handle large amounts of data at once. And they’re working with a single agent and context window instead of one in every cell.\r\n\r\nAnd Riveter’s web browsing can go further—even reading PDFs and images that may contain answers. \r\n\r\nWith Riveter, anyone can automate complex, auditable web research… without coding. \r\n\r\nOur founding team brings deep product and engineering expertise from to YC-backed companies Gusto, Retool, and Middesk.",
