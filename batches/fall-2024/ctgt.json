  "long_description": "Enterprises are paralyzed by the risks of deploying generative AI. Traditional methods like RAG and fine-tuning are brittle, expensive, and fail to prevent costly hallucinations or guarantee compliance in high-stakes environments. This lack of trust stalls innovation and blocks ROI.\r\n\r\nCTGT ensures strict, auditable adherence to your policies on the fly. We deliver defensible audit trails and remediate noncompliant model behavior, so outputs become more aligned with company policies over time, combating data and model drift.\r\n\r\nCTGT is backed by Google's AI fund (Gradient), General Catalyst, and luminaries like Paul Graham. We provide the control and confidence necessary to unlock the full potential of enterprise AI.",
