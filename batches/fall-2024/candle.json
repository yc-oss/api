  "long_description": "Most relationships, romantic or platonic, don’t end in one moment, they drift apart over time. Missed check-ins, surface-level conversations, busy lives, and routines replace real connection. Candle helps couples and friends stay close through 1-minute daily rituals that bring back presence, play, and curiosity.\r\n\r\nCandle gives couples and friends a daily, low-pressure game designed to create emotional momentum: the most essential, and often most neglected, ingredient in long-term connection.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a swipeable questions game has grown into a full platform and private space for your relationship:\r\n\r\n- Daily Prompts & Games: Thoughtful, funny, and unexpected questions, couple quizzes, audio and photo challenges that update and adapt monthly\r\n\r\n- Shared Canvas Widget: Leave notes, doodles, or drawings right on each other’s home screen\r\n\r\n- Now in beta: Date Ideas Swiping**: Get 60 curated date ideas based on your area (yes, even San Francisco :)), updated weekly. Swipe to match on what you both want to try. From pop-up events to hidden gems, it’s the easiest way to try something new together or even with friends or family! We’d love feedback here!\r\n\r\n- Streaks & Shared Progress — Build accountability and a shared rhythm\r\n\r\n- Adaptive Decks: Smarter, more relevant questions over time\r\n\r\n- Shared Photo Albums & Memories: Keep track of all your photos and logged memories\r\n",
