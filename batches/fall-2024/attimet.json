  "long_description": "We’re building a research lab that puts its ideas to the test in one of the most complex, information-rich environments in the world: the financial markets.\r\n\r\nMuch of trading still depends on hand-crafted signals and intuition. We’re approaching it differently - from first principles. We design systems that learn, adapt, and improve with data. Our infrastructure is built to accelerate research: fast iteration loops, real-time feedback, and direct connection between ideas and outcomes.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting with liquid markets like equities and options - high-dimensional, dynamic systems where traditional pipelines break down. Our goal isn’t just to model them better - it’s to build a platform for experimentation, where every result tightens the loop between theory and practice.\r\n\r\nIf you care about learning systems, clean abstractions, and applying research in the wild - we’re hiring.",
