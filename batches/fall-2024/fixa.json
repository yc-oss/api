  "long_description": "Fixa is the Sentry for AI voice agents. Companies like 11x and OfOne use us to run simulated tests, analyze production calls, and fix bugs in their voice agents. \r\n\r\nWe were both voice agent developers at PlayHT – and, in order to find bugs in our agents, we would spend countless hours manually calling them and listening to conversation recordings. So, we’ve decided to build a platform that does this automatically. \r\n\r\nFixa shows developers exactly where and how their agents mess up – enabling them to pinpoint root causes and fix them faster.
