  "long_description": "Edgedive is the agent that triages & debugs your eng team's oncall issues to reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). It:\r\n\r\n- Automates your oncall runbook for incoming issues to provide an impact assessment, root cause, and plan to fix.\r\n- Opens merge-ready PRs that build cleanly and follow your team’s standards.\r\n- Can be triggered from Slack, Linear, Asana, or automatically from support tickets or alerts (ex. Intercom, Sentry, etc)\r\n\r\nIt’s like having a teammate that responds to issues 24/7, gathering the context your team needs to address them ASAP.",
