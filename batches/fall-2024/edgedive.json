  "long_description": "Edgedive is your AI support engineer - embedded where your team already works (Intercom, Linear, Slack, GitHub, etc.). It:\r\n\r\n- Auto-investigates issues end-to-end: root cause, impact assessment, plan to fix.\r\n- Opens merge-ready PRs that build cleanly and follow your team’s standards.\r\n- Can be triggered from Slack, Linear, Github, or automatically from support tickets or alerts (ex. Intercom, Sentry, etc)\r\n\r\nIt’s like having a 24/7 teammate who continuously triages issues, plans fixes, and pushes merge-ready code changes so you can start your morning with high-quality PRs, ready for review.",
