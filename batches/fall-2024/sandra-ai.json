  "long_description": "Sandra AI is building the AI operating system for car dealerships, replacing clumsy legacy software with an AI-native, automation-driven platform. Founded by 3 McKinsey, HEC & MIT alumni who met 10 years ago at Ecole Polytechnique, the company’s AI agents already automates all customer interactions across calls & messages, and increasingly run dealership operations by automating sales and aftersales workflows end-to-end. This operational footprint naturally extends into a proprietary software layer that unifies billing, scheduling, inventory, and CRM into a single dealership OS. ",
