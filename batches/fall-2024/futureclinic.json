  "long_description": "FutureClinic is a platform that makes it easy for any doctor to open their own digital clinic. Our AI assistant takes a comprehensive medical history using an empathic chat or voice-based interface, uses sophisticated medical reasoning to narrow down likely diagnoses, and produces evidence-based treatment suggestions for each patient. Licensed doctors then review the text-based summaries of the cases our AI provides, and choose how to manage the patients. In this fashion, we're able to deliver end-to-end healthcare in a way that makes personalized, expert healthcare scalable to 8 billion people around the world. ",
