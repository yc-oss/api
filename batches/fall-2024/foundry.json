  "long_description": "We’re building browser-native infrastructure that makes software creation production-ready end-to-end. Today’s AI tools can scaffold code, but they fail on the critical workflows that actually get products into production — provisioning, auth, QA, and compliance — all of which happen inside the browser.\r\n\r\nOur system makes these workflows deterministic, reproducible, and automatable, so both agents and humans can go from idea to a production-ready app. The opportunity is massive: billions of dollars of value locked up in workflows that today block non-technical founders and slow technical teams. We’re building the infrastructure layer that makes production possible.",
