  "long_description": "Kalshi (www.kalshi.com) is the first federally regulated exchange where you can trade on the outcome of events.  We built Kalshi because we believe that people should be able to capitalize on what they know and have opinions on. We make this possible by expanding what people can trade on and allowing them trade in the domain of everyday knowledge. \r\n\r\nKalshi is developing a new asset class, “event contracts,” and a financial exchange for trading on the outcome of events: we are federally regulated by the CFTC as the first-ever legal futures exchange in the U.S. for trading on a broad category of events.",
