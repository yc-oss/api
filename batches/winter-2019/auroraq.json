  "long_description": "At AuroraQ, we are building the worldâ€™s first truly practical quantum computing system.  This system integrates together different quantum components, each performing different functions with the data, including processing, communication, and memory.  Integration of different specialized components that efficiently work together to complete the calculation is precisely how classical computers work.  No other quantum hardware company has yet tackled the integration challenge.  AuroraQ will be the Dell of quantum computing, sourcing components from our partners to build a better quantum computer.
