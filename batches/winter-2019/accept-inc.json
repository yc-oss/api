  "long_description": "In a transaction powered by Board, sellers and agents are doing business with Board -- not the buyer.  We act as an intermediary buyer of a home, using our cash to buy homes for the 80% of homebuyers who need and qualify for a mortgage. By removing the lender from real estate transactions,  sellers and agents to close in as little as 2-3 days and buyers can lock-in their homes of choice at the best possible price before closing on their mortgage. \r\n\r\nWith Board, buyers can \"Buy Now. Mortgage Later\" so everyone can have a cash deal.  \r\n\r\nWe differentiate ourselves from others in the \"iBuyer\" market by allowing anyone to have an all cash deal as opposed to buying, fixing and flipping properties for ourselves (e.g. Opendoor, OfferPad...etc). Board works directly with national lenders to evaluate the creditworthiness of buyers upfront and will use a short term credit facility to facilitate the purchasing of homes. \r\n\r\n",
