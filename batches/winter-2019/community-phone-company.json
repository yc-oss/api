  "long_description": "Community Phone is building the best phone for communities in America. We are your hair salon’s business phone, how your auto-body shop texts you or gets appointments, your local government agency’s operations line, and your mom’s phone that she sometimes answers on her computer. We have more than 20,000 customers today, and are building the Square of phones.\r\n\r\nOur team is ~80 people strong, across 15 countries. We are growing quickly, backed by Y Combinator Accelerator and Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund. We are customer-obsessed to the core. When we had a major network outage, everyone from recruiters to engineers to marketers to customer support agents got on the phone with our customers. Our team exemplifies our purpose. Join us on our mission to make it as easy as possible for people and people at organizations in our communities to communicate.",
