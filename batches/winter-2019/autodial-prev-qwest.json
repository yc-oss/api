  "long_description": "Previous Qwest (W19) - skip busy club lines. Autodial (currently exiting) is a service for skipping busy phone lines for everyday people calling businesses. Our goal is to connect people directly to customer service via phone lines by reducing the wait time from 60 minutes to 5 minutes. We cover 10,000 phone lines ranging from financial institutions, telecom, home services, government, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Pivot\r\nClub and restaurant lines were non-existent during COVID. We reset the company and shifted focus using more technical skills in machine learning to build a service that millions of americans could use and leverage in the moment -- a service that called government phone lines and handled the call process.\r\n\r\nSucceeding we expanded quickly expanded and built a model to support people using the service for free.
