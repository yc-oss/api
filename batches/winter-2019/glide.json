  "long_description": "Glide is a web-based app builder that allows non-programmers to quickly create powerful and beautiful apps by combining prebuilt components with a familiar spreadsheet model.\r\n\r\nApp development has barely changed in 30 years. Glide will bring app development out of the Dark Ages, making it web-based, collaborative, and fun. Think of Google Docs or Figma but for building apps.\r\n\r\nWe believe that almost all apps can be built 10-100x faster, with higher quality, by starting with the data model and generating a polished app from high-level components that users customize.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to make it easy and fun for anyone to build amazing apps without code. In ten years, we want the majority of apps worldwide to have been built with Glide.\r\n\r\nWe're four technical founders with expertise in native mobile frameworks, developer tools, and product design. We've worked together for 5-10 years, and were all early employees at Xamarin, a mobile developer tools startup acquired by Microsoft in 2016.",
