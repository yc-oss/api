  "long_description": "Keeper is AI tax filing for complex returns. We serve individuals and small businesses in the US. Today, over 50% of tax returns still get filed by accountants - that’s 75M returns a year. Unfortunately, great accountants are really hard to find, and the data shows most of them are retiring in the next 5-10 years. \r\n\r\nKeeper is the modern alternative. We use AI to automate most of the prep work, which frees up in-house human tax experts to focus on guidance and reviewing final results. The net outcome is that we’re able to deliver higher quality / more accurate returns at 50% of the cost of traditional accountants.",
