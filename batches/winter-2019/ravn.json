  "long_description": "Ravn is a DefenseTech company building a heads-up display for soldiers that will allow them to see around corners. In doing so, we allow them to see the enemy and react while they're still behind cover. Our lightweight heads-up display displays videos feeds from a camera on a gun, to drones, robots or other external platforms. Our heads-up display will become a soldier's most relied upon computer.\r\n\r\nWe currently have four team members, all very experienced in their respective fields. Jake, the Founder, is a former Navy SEAL and understands the market and product. Our Chief Science Officer, Karl Guttag, is an industry leader in the optics and display space. Our VPs of Software and Hardware are both very experienced in their fields. Our primary technology focus is on peer-to-peer applications, near eye optics and displays, cameras/sensors/IoT, and UI/UX (hardware and software).\r\n\r\n ",
