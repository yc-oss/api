  "long_description": "Avo fixes data quality in product analytics. Avo helps teams like Ikea, Wolt, Fender, Sixt and Condé Nast to plan, implement and monitor analytics, so they don't fly blind and fail to build great user experiences\r\n\r\nStart your step-by-step path to settle your analytics debt:\r\n\r\nStep 1: Better tracking plan management.\r\nAvo is a better alternative to the \"tracking plan spreadsheet\", keeping your data quality high and your schema sync'd with all downstream tools. Import your tracking plan for an instant audit, then design more scalable data for every feature release, even before you're an expert.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Better data validation.\r\nAvo is ongoing observability of actual tracking compared with tracking plan. One-time install the Avo Inspector SDK to see what's wrong with your tracking today so you can start making it better.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Better analytics release workflow.\r\nAvo is the self-serve analytics governance, changing how PMs, devs and data scientists collaborate to plan, implement and verify their product analytics. What used to take Patreon 1-4 days for every feature release, now takes 30-60 minutes.",
