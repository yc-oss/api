  "long_description": "SpaceRyde is building the future of space cargo transportation to facilitate and encourage necessary in-space developments, innovations and economy. SpaceRyde is the only sustainable mode of space transportation. Its innovative system utilizes a stratospheric balloon to bypass the atmosphere without emissions nor depositing black particles into the ozone layer and is the world’s first and only multi-functional rocket. After completing its initial mission, the vehicle will remain powered in orbit and joins its rocket network until assigned its next in-space mission, including tasks such as; refuelling, deep space missions, space junk removal and de-orbiting. \r\n\r\nSpaceRyde’s story began in 2018 with husband-wife founders Saharnaz Safari and Sohrab Haghighat and the dream of eliminating the barriers to innovation in space. The company is now a rapidly growing team of over 30 employees with a 25,000-square-foot rocket factory and state-of-the-art engine groundworks facility.",
