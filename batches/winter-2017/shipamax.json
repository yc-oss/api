  "long_description": "Shipamax's core technology can 'understand' any logistics document - outputting a business-ready, machine-readable format. \r\n\r\nWhy does this matter? When customers order online - it feels smooth & simple. But in the background it's chaos. When goods are physically moved around the world, there can be up to 20 companies involved in the transaction. Currently, this is a complex, messy process, with different systems and teams creating a mountain of manual work to get the job done.\r\n\r\nCustomers value our technology as we to help make these behind-the-sceens processes simple.\r\n\r\nWe're making one of the largest segments of the global economy – logistics – more scalable and adaptable to today's on-demand world.",
