  "long_description": "Pit.AI Technologies aims at solving intelligence for investment management. We combine bleeding-edge AI research with powerful computing to automatically mine profitable trading strategies in financial markets. \r\n\r\nOur proprietary pipeline departs from the standard portfolio optimization paradigm in that it avoids making unrealistic assumptions on how markets behave, and it applies the expressiveness of our AI techniques on large scale data to automatically detect and exploit new sources of market inefficiencies, rather than testing or verifying human-generated trading ideas, intuitions, or forecasting models.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the investment management industry is at the dawn of a new AI-led era where trading idea generation will be automated and cost-effective, management fees will be a thing of the past, and fund managers will no longer be paid for merely showing up.",
