  "long_description": "At Nuvola, we're commercializing SafeCoat, a spray-on separator that is directly deposited onto electrodes, removing the need for conventional separator films and the massive infrastructure to build them.\r\n\r\nSafeCoat has been piloted with top-tier battery and automotive manufacturers and is ready for commercial deployment. Industry leaders are drawn to its impact: it reduces fire risk by 99%, cuts manufacturing scrap by 70%, and saves $350M per 40GWh factory. Our capital-light model requires just $8M in CAPEX to reach profitability in 2027.",
