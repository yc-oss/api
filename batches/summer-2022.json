This is poised to be a best-in-class, potentially breakthrough therapy for treating iron deficiency without any GI side-effects (eg. nausea, constipation, diarrhea, etc.) typically associated with oral iron supplements, and without the risks, costs and side-effects associated with IV iron infusions. When approved, Keylika’s proprietary transdermal iron will be the world's first prescription iron patch. Iron deficiency is a hugely understated problem affecting about 1.6 billion people worldwide and more than 30 million in the US alone, translating to a $17B US market.",

It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\r\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

It is perpetual and is completely on-chain, end-to-end. It is held as a token in wallets and can be sold/transferred to anyone at any time.\r\n\r\nAt institutional level, using EthosX’s options infrastructure two hedge funds can trade high-value on-chain options with each other directly without involving any banks or brokers with zero counterparty risk and zero settlement risk.\r\n\r\nWe are also providing derivatives infrastructure to other crypto companies who want to use these products as a part of a larger package to their customers.\r\n\r\nGlobal derivatives ecosystem is broken. Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nWe at EthosX intend to pick the best of both worlds and change the way retail and institutional financial derivatives are traded world over.",

In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.\r\n\r\nUntil Sunlight.\r\n\r\nWith our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.\r\n\r\nThe Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!",

Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.",

That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. \r\n\r\nOur first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the \"green penalty\" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms.  \r\n\r\nFirst generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nBeyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside. \r\n\r\n",

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.\r\n",

While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process — involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers aren’t even aware that their payment failed.\r\n\r\n💰 Bottom line?\r\nEffective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10%\r\n\r\nFLYCODE SOLUTION 💡\r\nFlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn.

Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.

Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results.\r\n\r\nArgovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale.

We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.

Data has shown dendritic cells are often dysfunctional in cancer patients, and that this dysfunction is a bottleneck for other therapies. \r\n\r\nGuardian Bio’s approach is focused on creating a dendritic cell-based product which drives anti-tumor activity through activating the killers of the immune system AND training them against multiple cancer targets. We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. \r\n\r\nOur therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer.",
