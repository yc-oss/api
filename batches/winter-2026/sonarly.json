  "long_description": "We’d like to automate monitoring. To advance that mission, we’re building Sonarly.\r\n\r\nSoftware has two phases: build time and run time. Coding agents are getting great at build time, but production is still a mess of charts, logs, and noisy alerts. Sonarly triages production alerts, deduping - prioritizing, and attaching the missing context - so teams can trust what pages them and fix the right issue fast. As you deploy new code, Sonarly keeps alerts and investigations up to date automatically.",
