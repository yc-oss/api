  "long_description": "Visibl is an AI platform that turns compute into chip design capacity.\r\n\r\nAs chips grow more complex, adding engineers yields diminishing returns — coordination costs rise while progress slows. The bottleneck is no longer ideas, but execution throughput.\r\n\r\nVisibl turns compute into a teammate. Our platform ingests the full design context (code, specs, scripts, tool outputs) to decode ambiguous tool feedback into actionable steps. We validate changes and package decisions for review, resulting in safer changes, shorter iteration cycles, and fewer late surprises on the path to tapeout.",
