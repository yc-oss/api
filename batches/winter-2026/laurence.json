  "long_description": "Advertising today is like trading in the 1980s pits: archaic, manual, and iterative guesswork. Humans update bids and keywords using noisy, delayed data with fixed rules that both break at scale and ignore stochasticity.\r\n\r\nWe've built quantitative systems that advertise the way modern hedge-funds trade markets: continuous decision-making under stochastic outcomes and explicit profit constraints.\r\n\r\nOur models systematically price bids, allocate budgets, and adjust targeting based on observed conversion signals and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nStarting with sellers on Amazon, we are automating millions in live ad spend, increasing gross sales while decreasing advertising cost of sales by 40%.",
