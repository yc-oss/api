  "long_description": "Traditional warehouse automation is broken. It's expensive, it takes forever to implement, and it's not flexible. Many warehouses are stuck with automation systems that have become \"old iron\" after their operations changed slightly.\r\n\r\nWe train and deploy robots to automate warehouse tasks. The robot learns new tasks on the job and improves over time.\r\n\r\nInstead of writing off the automation, our robots increase in value over time.",
