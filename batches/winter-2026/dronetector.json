  "long_description": "We make radars that can see small drones.\r\n\r\nAs drones evolve faster than air defenses, detection has fallen behind. Even $50 drones now present a major threat to airports, critical infrastructure, and front-line defense.\r\n\r\nWe solve this by building high-frequency radar systems, designed from the ground up to detect even the most challenging low-signature targets. This allows us to identify and track nano drones like no other solution, letting you know what's truly in your airspace. ",
