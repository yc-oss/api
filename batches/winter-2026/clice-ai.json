  "long_description": "Clice gives everyone on your team a personal AI agent that actually executes. Every agent knows their person's context, and every agent can talk to each other.\r\n\r\nNeed an answer from someone who's offline? Your agent asks their agent. A bug gets fixed in prod? Your agent updates the ticket and responds to the thread. Need to meet before launch? Your agent coordinates with theirs and books it.\r\n\r\nSales, eng, ops. If it involves communicating or coordinating across people, Clice handles it. You focus on the work that actually matters.",
