  "long_description": "We help electrical contractors do electrical estimates way faster using AI. Electrical contractors submit RFPs (request for proposals) to win contracts to jobs like building the electrical infrastructure for a new data center, and they compete with other electrical contractors to win these jobs. The process of submitting these RFPs take a majority of an electrical contractors time, specifically in providing an estimate for the job, and Bidflow aims to optimize the redundant paperwork that goes into this process.",
