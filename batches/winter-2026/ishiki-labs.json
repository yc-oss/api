  "long_description": "Current multimodal models can see and hear. But they talk when they shouldn't. They can't tell if you're speaking to them or someone else. We are building an AI that knows when to stay silent, yet still understanding what's going on in your conversation, so it can best assist when you do need it in real time.\r\n\r\nOur first version, fern-0.1: provides real-time expert opinions on demand, instant task delegation, zero interruptions. All as fast as ChatGPT voice and Gemini live.",
