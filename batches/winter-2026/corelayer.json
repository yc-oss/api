  "long_description": "We’re building AI agents that do on-call support for data-heavy industries like financial services and fintech, healthcare, and insurance.\r\n\r\nOn-call engineers in these industries need to inspect data to debug production issues. We monitor both data and infrastructure for issues and use AI agents to debug and suggest fixes in minutes.\r\n\r\nData is especially sensitive in regulated industries, so we offer on-prem deployments and hardware-backed secure environments that let agents safely use production data as context while debugging.\r\n\r\nMitch and Shipra founded Corelayer after building data infrastructure together at Goldman Sachs, where they spent many late nights and weekends debugging systems that processed 100s of billions of rows a day.",
