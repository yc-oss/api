  "long_description": "At AutoSitu, we’re building coordinated AI agents that live inside cities’ cross-department development review workflows—doing the heavy lifting, escalating judgment calls, and letting staff focus where human expertise actually matters. AutoSitu provides expert-level guidance and catch issues in minutes, helping cities and design firms/developers navigate an increasingly complex and fragmented regulatory environment. We serve as a strategic partner to forward-thinking public agencies and design teams across the country and are backed by Y Combinator (W26).",
