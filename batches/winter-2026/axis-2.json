  "long_description": "Axis is building a model-driven analysis platform for the commodities trading industry. Commodities make up a third of global goods exports, and physical commodities traders decide the movement and storage of metals, agricultural products, and energy (Crude, Refined Products, Natural Gas, Petroleum) across the globe. Due to the size of these markets, commodities traders monitor data sources spanning prices and derivatives, refinery data, storage inventory, import/exports, geopolitical events and more. Axis is building an analytical layer for these markets, allowing a trader or analyst to deploy models for monitoring information relevant to their strategy. \r\n",
