  "long_description": "Tensol is the AI-native operating system for hospitality. We replace legacy hotel ERPs and back-office software with one system that runs guest communications, bookings, reviews, procurement, and invoicing in a single place, where AI agents answer guest messages, send quotes and confirmations, update bookings, respond to reviews, and log everything directly in the system.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting with guest communications and review management, where AI agents handle inbound guest requests and reviews end-to-end, making front-office teams 3x more productive, resolving 80% of inquiries automatically, increasing upsells and brand reputation.",
