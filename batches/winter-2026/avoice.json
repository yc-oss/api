  "long_description": "AVoice brings full visibility to the physical side of sales.\r\n\r\nMost sales intelligence tools only track digital interactions — emails, calls, CRM entries — but the majority of global revenue is still driven by in-person visits. Reps take photos, record voice notes, send quick messages, and make on-site observations, but this information is scattered, unstructured, and rarely reaches the CRM.\r\n\r\nAVoice automatically captures, analyzes, and structures everything that happens during a field visit. Photos, voice notes, text updates, and observations are instantly transformed into searchable insights for reps, managers, and leadership. AVoice highlights risks, opportunities, buying signals, product issues, market trends, and territory health in real time.\r\n\r\nBy turning the offline economy into usable data, AVoice gives companies the visibility they’ve always had for digital sales — now applied to the real world where deals are actually won.",
