  "long_description": "Polymath is an applied research lab focused on increasing the reliability and autonomy of AI agents, in order to better serve people. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the primary bottleneck to getting agents to perform reliably across long horizons is the quality, complexity, and scale of RL environments.\r\n\r\nWe're building the infrastructure to produce high-fidelity training and evaluation environments at scale, providing frontier labs with the building blocks they need to make the next breakthrough.",
