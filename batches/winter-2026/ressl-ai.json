  "long_description": "Ressl AI is building AI Agents to disrupt IT Services.\r\n\r\nEnterprise applications like Salesforce are highly flexible and configurable, allowing them to adapt to the unique processes of different businesses. But implementing and maintaining Salesforce requires specialised Salesforce admins or outsourced consulting firms—both of which are expensive and slow.\r\n\r\nAt Ressl AI, we’re building 10× AI Salesforce Admins. Our agents let IT and RevOps teams configure Salesforce in plain English, accelerating Salesforce delivery by 10× without adding headcount.\r\n\r\nOur agents can:\r\n\r\n> Document your Salesforce org\r\n> Find root causes of support issues\r\n> Perform analysis and dependency mapping\r\n> Configure flows and automations\r\n> Write Apex code and test classes\r\n> Upgrade orgs from legacy versions\r\n\r\nBefore building Ressl, Arushi and Abhishek ran an IT consulting firm for six months, using those learnings to productise RevOps and Salesforce consulting.\r\n\r\nThe global IT outsourcing market is projected to reach ~$600B in 2025. Ressl AI is excited to define what an agentic Accenture looks like.",
