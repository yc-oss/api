  "long_description": "Scout Out helps clients hire the right builder by turning building plans into fast, comparable bids.\r\n\r\nToday, every contractor who wants to bid on a project has to independently estimate material and labor quantities. That makes bidding slow, expensive, and inconsistent — and homeowners often end up comparing apples to oranges.\r\n\r\nScout Out automates this step. We use computer vision trained on building plans to generate standardized material and labor takeoffs once, in-house. We then share those takeoffs with vetted contractors, so everyone is bidding on the same scope.\r\n\r\nThe result: homeowners get more bids, faster turnaround, and clearer pricing — without asking each contractor to redo the same estimation work.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting in Los Angeles, helping homeowners rebuild after the Palisades and Eaton fires.",
