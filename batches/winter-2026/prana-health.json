  "long_description": "Prana replaces the reactive, 15-minute annual physical with continuous, proactive care. We connect to your medical records and wearables to watch for \"clinical drift,\" catching subtle declines in health that human doctors miss between visits.\r\n\r\nMost AI health apps are just chatbots. Prana is a full-stack medical provider. Our AI acts as a always-on physician that watches your data, explains your labs, and manages your prescriptions.\r\n\r\nSafety & Scale: We automate 90% of the \"grunt work\" (history taking, logistics, triage) so our human doctors can focus purely on high-leverage decisions. This allows us to offer <60 minute access to a physician, 24/7, for a fraction of the cost of traditional care.\r\n\r\nThe Team:\r\n - Meer Patel (CEO): JHU BME. Deferred Brown Medical School to build Prana because code scales better than appointments.\r\n- Vishvam Rawal (CTO): Ex-Quant. Building high-frequency data infrastructure for health signals.\r\n- Sanjit Menon (CHO): Graduating MD Candidate. Deep clinical expertise to ensure our models practice good medicine.\r\n\r\nTraction: Live in beta with early users.",
