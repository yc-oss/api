  "long_description": "LegalOS is an AI-native immigration law firm that combines cutting-edge technology with 40+ years of legal expertise.\r\n\r\nWe’ve studied 12,000 successful petitions to design our process - which allows us to deliver top-quality visa applications in as quickly as 48 hours. Our specialized AI agents draft petition narratives, compile evidence, and anticipate USCIS objections - work that traditionally takes attorneys weeks, if not months.\r\n\r\nEvery case is reviewed and signed by licensed immigration attorneys with 40+ years of experience, so companies get both speed and reliability. We support O-1, H-1B, L-1A, L-1B, TN, EB-1A, EB-1C, and EB-2 NIW petitions.\r\n\r\nOur unique approach works. We’ve filed dozens of visa applications and have a 100% approval rate so far.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. processes 1M+ work visas annually—a market where incumbents still operate on fax machines, email, and 1990s case management software. We're building the modern immigration law firm.",
