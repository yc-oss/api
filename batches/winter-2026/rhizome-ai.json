  "long_description": "$8 trillion dollars of market cap needs to know what the FDA thinks. Rhizome AI makes that happen. \r\n\r\nUsers ask a question and get an answer backed by up to 1,000 documents, where each statement has a citation. The data is pulled from terabytes of authoritative regulatory & clinical databases. \r\n\r\nChetan started his career as a research engineer, but quickly realized he enjoyed building more than research. He joined EvolutionaryScale as their sole founding product engineer, launching their developer-scientist platform and scaling to tens of thousands of users and billions of API calls. He was also #16 at Instabase helping banks with document & imaging processing, closing $7m as the technical lead. \r\n\r\nBeing so plugged into the AI world, he saw lots of AI drug discovery companies, but very few AI companies focused on bringing those drugs to market. Talking to people, it quickly became clear that a big, expensive barrier was understanding FDA thinking. \r\n\r\nRhizome’s first product, Rhizome Ask, went from launch to six-figures in revenue during 2025.",
