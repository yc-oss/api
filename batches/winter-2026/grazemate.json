  "long_description": "GrazeMate builds autonomous drones that herd cattle.\r\n\r\nAt the push of a button, our AI drones fly to a paddock, position themselves around the herd and guide them to new paddocks. Instead of a full day mustering with helicopters, motorbikes, and horses, farmers use GrazeMate.\r\n\r\nWe work with the world's largest cattle ranches, giving them complete visibility into their operations. While our drones herd cattle autonomously, they simultaneously estimate animal weights, measure grass biomass, monitoring water levels, and detect sick animals. We're building physical AI that gives farmers superhuman capabilities - managing thousands of livestock across massive distances from their phone.",
