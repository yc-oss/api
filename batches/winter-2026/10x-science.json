  "long_description": "Our mission at 10x Science is to enable biopharmaceutical development to keep pace with AI-powered drug discovery. \r\n\r\nThanks to AI, the front end of drug discovery is flooding the pipeline with new drug candidates. However, current solutions for drug development are unable to resolve drug complexity and cannot keep up with modern demand. Our platform is the unlock for this bottleneck. \r\n\r\nBy applying modern AI to the development stage, specifically to protein characterization and quality assessment, we provide an end-to-end solution to dramatically speed up and scale up the preparation of candidates for the clinic. \r\n\r\nOur team is composed of Stanford University researchers from a Nobel Laureate's lab with 18+ years of collective domain expertise, 47+ scientific publications, and a 2x YC Founder. We move at the highest velocity and are positioned to lead the next-generation of modern AI drug development. ",
