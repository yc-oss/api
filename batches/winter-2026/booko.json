  "long_description": " Booko helps appointment-based businesses make more money by dynamically pricing their time. Unlike physical inventory, unsold hours disappear forever, yet most service businesses still rely on static pricing. We integrate with existing booking systems to adjust prices and incentives based on historical utilization, availability, and demand. Early customers see ~20% revenue uplift by selling time that would have otherwise gone unsold. ",
