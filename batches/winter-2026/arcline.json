  "long_description": "Arcline provides AI-native legal services for startups, with same-day turnaround & elite lawyers in the loop. Our AI does 80% of the work, so startups pay elite lawyers only for the final 20%.\r\n\r\nArcline’s founder Pamir, ex-outside counsel to OpenAI, saw the same issues on repeat when lawyers were serving startups: simple legal work took weeks, pricing was opaque, and lawyers kept starting from scratch instead of using AI.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a bench of top-tier startup lawyers to change that - folks from top schools (Harvard, Stanford, Oxford) and leading firms (Cooley, Goodwin, Fenwick). \r\n\r\nArcline’s lawyers start with first drafts generated with AI, and then do final revisions. This ends up reducing the work by up to 80% - so startups pay elite lawyers only for the final 20%.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, your legal matters can often be handled same-day. No other law firm today offers this kind of speed.\r\n\r\nWe’ve scaled to helping several Y-companies and 50+ venture-backed startups across the US and Nordics. \r\n\r\nDiscover Arcline: arcline-ai.com",
