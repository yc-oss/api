  "long_description": "CodeWisp lets anyone build and publish web games using plain-English prompts.\r\n\r\nTraditional game development requires learning complex engines, managing assets and code, and following rigid workflows, making it slow and inaccessible for most people.\r\n\r\nWith CodeWisp, users describe the game they want. CodeWisp generates the game’s code, structure, and assets, and users can refine it with follow-up prompts. This makes it possible to go from idea to a playable web game in minutes, without prior game-development experience.",
