  "long_description": "Sarah AI is building the AI-native operating system for consumer goods brands—an autonomous supply-chain brain that replaces legacy ERPs and actually runs the business. Founded by Chris (2x Founder; ex-CEO at Better Nature; Forbes 30U30), Dirk (ex-Google Data, Analytics & AI Lead), and Matthew (ex-Head of Product at Rosemark; Princeton MEng in CompSci), we’re backed by YC (W26).\r\n\r\nIn our first month full-time, we’ve raised $1.6M and secured rapid commercial traction with 15 design partners and a growing pipeline of 30+ brands. Our mission is bold: give CPG brands completely hands-free supply chains that run themselves through Sarah, their AI ops assistant.\r\n\r\nWe’re now growing a small, world-class team of builders excited to reinvent how physical goods companies operate—end-to-end, autonomous, and AI-first. If you want to work on hard problems, ship fast, and define the future of autonomous operations, you’ll feel right at home here.",
