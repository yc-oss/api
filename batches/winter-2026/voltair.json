  "long_description": "Voltair builds drones that charge on transmission lines. For the first time, this allows for drones with infinite range. Removing battery swaps is the last step to deploy UAVs autonomously at scale. \r\n\r\nPower utilities are the perfect first customer. Extreme weather creates catastrophic wildfire liability, bankrupting utilities and making them uninsurable. Voltair's drone inspections identify critical maintenance concerns before they spark fires. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost. Following extreme weather, Voltair's forward deployed drones can rapidly patrol neighborhoods for electrical hazards.\r\n\r\nSince June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.\r\n\r\nWith 50 miles of range, we can service 90% of the U.S. land area. After power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate, and other inspection markets. At scale we are a new infrastructure layer for data on the physical world.",
