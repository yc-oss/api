  "long_description": "SAVA is rebuilding sheet metal manufacturing from the ground up. From Ford Trucks to NASA Space Shuttles, sheet metal is the cornerstone of American Manufacturing - but the industry runs on 30-year-old technology and a shrinking workforce.\r\n\r\nAlessio and Vedic competed in high school robotics when they met Jakob at Georgia Tech's Robotics labs. After witnessing Vedic's father's 12-hour shifts and visiting manufacturers across the US, they saw an industry trapped by legacy constraints: manual processes, skilled labor shortages, and unused automation.\r\n\r\nSAVA is building a fully integrated manufacturing system that eliminates skilled operators while delivering superior speed, quality, and economics. They're already reducing customer iteration cycles from 5-6 days to 1-2 days for companies like Pave Robotics - proving the technology works in real production environments.\r\n\r\nThey're not just replacing human operators with robots - they're building the foundation to replace an entire industry built on outdated technology with modern manufacturing intelligence.",
