  "long_description": "Kaelio is the modern alternative to Metabase and Looker.\r\n\r\nWe replace rigid dashboards with an AI-native interface that connects directly to your warehouse, letting teams explore data and build dashboards through conversation, not tickets or manual configuration.\r\n\r\nModern teams are done with Metabase and Looker. They are rigid, slow to change, and push every question back onto data or engineering teams.\r\n\r\nKaelio removes that tradeoff by giving everyone fast, flexible access to trusted, governed metrics through a shared interface, without adding work to data or engineering teams.",
