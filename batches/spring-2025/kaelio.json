  "long_description": "Kaelio is the unified intelligence layer for modern data teams.\r\n\r\nWe connect directly to the warehouse, turning complex models and metrics into a conversational interface that scales insights across the business â€” without adding to the data team's backlog.\r\n\r\nData leaders are stuck balancing speed and control: business teams need answers now, while data teams need consistency and governance. Kaelio bridges that gap by giving everyone access to trusted, governed insights through a single, intelligent interface.",
