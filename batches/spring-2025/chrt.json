  "long_description": "chrt is a logistics platform for time-critical shipping. We enable businesses to deliver their most critical items same-day.\r\n\r\nTime-Critical Logistics is a $30B market growing at a 20% CAGR driven by growth in American healthcare and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nBusinesses that place time-critical orders are enterprises who have urgent items they need to deliver ASAP. These orders are critical in nature and often require white glove service -- think therapeutic treatments for healthcare providers or specialized equipment for manufacturers. \r\n\r\nchrt provides a marketplace of professional couriers who pick up and deliver these orders. We build the software these couriers use to handle the shipments, including a driver app and fleet management tools. This gives us full control of the shipment and allows us to provide shippers with end-to-end tracking. It also allows us to intervene early if we notice something is going wrong.\r\n\r\nWe’re software engineers that became friends years ago at McKinsey. Kyle is an expert in Time-Critical Logistics, having led strategy at a leading startup in the space. Aaron is an expert at designing and implementing AI systems to handle complex coordination. We were shipping code together on nights and weekends for years before chrt; now we’re also shipping freight.",
