  "long_description": "We’re building an AI-powered Bloomberg Terminal using Financial Agents.\r\n\r\nI used to be a trader at Tower Research and Goldman Sachs, and I’m building Scalar Field with my co-founder Ramakant, who led engineering teams at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nWe’ve both spent our careers at the intersection of finance and technology — and we’re using that experience to reimagine how markets are analyzed and traded.\r\n\r\nScalar Field is built around a simple idea: most people log into a terminal because, consciously or subconsciously, they’re trying to validate a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nBut today’s terminals don’t help with that. They’re dashboards — not thinking tools.\r\n\r\nSo we built Scalar Field to change that: a platform where users can test any market hypothesis instantly using intelligent agents.\r\n\r\nYou can spin up agents that react to market events, run backtests across data from multiple asset classes, and even trigger trades when specific conditions are met — all in one place.",
