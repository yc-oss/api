  "long_description": "Aviro builds task-time intelligence for enterprise AI agents. We solve the core problem that's blocking enterprise AI adoption: agents fail not because models aren't smart enough, but because they can't learn from past executions or follow established workflows.\r\n\r\nOur solution, Cortex, is a runtime intelligence layer that helps agents follow proven enterprise workflows when they exist, safely improvise when they don't, and capture new best practices as they emerge. \r\n\r\nWe're building agents that compound capability over time through reinforcement learning and adhere to enterprise SOPs, without requiring constant fine-tuning or changing existing models or frameworks.",
