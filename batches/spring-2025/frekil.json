  "long_description": "Today, it takes months to understand how drugs perform in the real world, delaying safety insights, slowing approvals, and costing lives. Frekil turns that months-long process into minutes, with full auditability and regulatory-grade rigor.\r\n\r\nFrekil automatically generates real-world evidence of drug performance from EHR and claims data. It acts like an AI Biostatistician that understands medical ontologies and statistical methods, running complex analyses on autopilot.\r\n\r\nWe help Pharma, Biotech, CROs, and Clinical Researchers to run RWE studies 100x faster and produce publication-ready retrospective studies and FDA/EMA-ready evidence packages with transparent lineage in minutes.",
