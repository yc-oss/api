  "long_description": "We're building the first group chat with social skills.\r\n\r\nWhile everyone else is stuck with boring individual chatbots, we've cracked the impossible: Alfi reads the room, understands each person, and creates custom intelligence for every group chat.\r\n\r\nAlfi is your new social friend. The one who remembers everything, plans effortlessly, and keeps the crew together.\r\n\r\nHere's what that looks like:\r\n\r\n- Book restaurants together, with Yelp built in, directly in the chat. No more \"where should we go?\" spirals. Reserve instantly.\r\n- Create images with your friends: drop your crew into funny hats, wild scenes, anything you can dream up. Multiplayer image gen, first of its kind.\r\n- Social calendar: upcoming hangs, all in one place. Everyone on the same page.\r\n- Group Wrapped: who's the chattiest? Top inside jokes? Now you'll know.\r\n- Reminders & Memory: Alfi remembers your spots, your preferences, and nudges you to actually hang out.\r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of a quiet shift. Gen Z is leaving broadcast social media. They're retreating to group chats, smaller, more intentional and personal spaces where they're honestly themselves.\r\n\r\nBut group chats are also where plans go to die. Someone has to be \"the planner\" or nothing happens.\r\n\r\nWe believe the group chat is the real social network. Where the funniest moments and real conversations happen in real time. With Alfi, we hope to bring you together more expressively, a lot more often.\r\n\r\nThis technology will bring humanity closer than it's ever been before. Not replace connection, deepen it. That's the future we're building toward.\r\n",
