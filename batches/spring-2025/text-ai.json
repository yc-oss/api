  "long_description": "We're building the first AI agent that thinks like a group.\r\n\r\nWhile everyone else is stuck with boring individual chatbots, we've cracked the impossible: AI that reads the room, understands each person, and creates custom intelligence for every group chat.\r\n\r\ntext.ai doesn't just answer questions - it lives in your conversations, silently learns what makes each friend tick, and becomes the perfect agentic AI for YOUR specific crew.\r\n\r\nJump in right now: Works instantly in SMS, WhatsApp, and Telegram. Zero downloads. Zero setup. Just pure ambient group genius.\r\n\r\nüçï \"Find pizza spots we'll ALL actually like\" (remembers Sarah's gluten-free, Jake's spice tolerance, everyone's budget)\r\nüéâ \"Plan something epic for Saturday\" (knows the group's energy, who's free, what you actually enjoy)\r\nüî• \"Roast my terrible movie suggestion\" (adapts to your group's humor style and inside jokes)\r\n\r\nEvery group chat gets its own brain. Every friend gets understood. Every plan actually works.\r\n\r\nThe future isn't prompt ‚Üí response.\r\nIt's presence ‚Üí understanding ‚Üí creation.\r\n\r\nTry it now. Your friends will thank you.",
