  "long_description": "Foundation Industries supplies components to hard tech companies with a sharp focus on quick turn ability. Our manufacturing processes are purpose built for the high mix nature of prototype work which allows us to command better margins and turn times. \r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons U.S. Manufacturing has fallen behind is a lack of urgency. If I were to order a part in Shenzhen at 8 AM, it would be on my desk by lunch time. This compounds over time and we look to bring that same power law back to the Unites States starting in the Bay Area.\r\n\r\nOur first capability that we are starting with is high precision 5 axis milling. If you are in need of parts on a quick turn feel free to reach out to us at: founders@foundation-industries.com. We are doing a controlled release of the service if you would like to give us a shot, we will forward you a link and access key!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
