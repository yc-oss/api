  "long_description": "Code Four slashes the administrative burden on law enforcement through AI-driven automation. Officers spend up to a third of their shifts manually transcribing body camera footage, creating inaccuracies, reducing transparency, and cutting into frontline duties. We're here to eliminate these inefficiencies by integrating with body cameras, record management systems, and digital evidence management systems—acting as a software layer for data processing. \r\n\r\nWe free the most overworked and underappreciated people in the world: police officers.",
