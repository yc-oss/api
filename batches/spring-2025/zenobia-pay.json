  "long_description": "Zenobia Pay enables luxury brands and jewelers to accept pay-by-bank. We’ve built an instant clearing pay-by-bank network with bundled fraud insurance that costs 3 times less in fees than credit card processing.\r\n\r\nWe are building Zenobia Pay specifically for expensive goods. Items are high intentionality, so we can actually convert customers at checkout. Payments go through your phone without you having to download an app.\r\n\r\nWe use purchase metadata to provide a digital proof of purchase for the entire lifespan of luxury goods so that brands can earn fees verification fees on the $39B resale market, which is growing 3 times faster than new sales. \r\n\r\nZenobia Pay is a branded pay-by-bank rewards network that is the default payment mechanism for all purchases over $200.",
