  "long_description": "Tropir is the first AI that builds better AIs.\r\n\r\nWe don’t just trace where your pipeline broke—we fix it. Tropir analyzes the flow of logic across prompts, tools, and retrievals to pinpoint root causes, suggests targeted changes, reruns the pipeline with those fixes, and runs evals to check if things actually improved. If not, it keeps iterating until they do. You build the flow. We make it unbreakable.\r\n\r\nWe're already used by teams building advanced agents, copilots, and RAG pipelines. As LLM-based systems grow, we believe Tropir will become essential infrastructure for every serious AI team.",
