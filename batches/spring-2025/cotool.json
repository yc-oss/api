  "long_description": "Cotool is an agentic security platform that eliminates manual and repetitive work for security teams.\r\n\r\nToday’s cybersecurity teams remain bogged down by alert fatigue, context switching, and documentation overhead. Security teams don't need more dashboards with \"AI-powered insights\" — they need their time back.\r\n\r\nCotool empowers teams to build security their way. Our platform provides an AI co-pilot that automatically assembles context across tools, a no-code agent builder that transforms successful investigations into reusable automations, and automated report generation, providing comprehensive documentation in seconds.\r\n\r\nUnlike solutions that force teams to adapt to vendor workflows, Cotool puts the power of AI directly in practitioners' hands, letting them shape tools around their unique processes. Early users have already cut time spent on investigation and detection engineering by 70%.",
