  "long_description": "Property appraisals suck — September’s new federal rules will make them even worse.\r\n\r\nValueMate’s LiDAR-plus-AI app captures a property in a three-minute walkthrough and delivers a regulator-ready report on our dashboard, slashing cycle times by 80% for the valuation firms already on board.\r\n\r\nIn the next few months, every bank, AMC, and independent appraiser must switch to the new format or watch loans pile up. ValueMate handles the transition end-to-end, with zero tape measures, zero data entry, and zero closing delay.\r\n\r\nWe’re transforming the multi-billion dollar appraisal industry with technology that captures millions of 3D data points per walkthrough.",
