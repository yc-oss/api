  "long_description": "VibeGrade is the AI that works directly inside Google Classroom, Google Docs, and Canvas to grade papers 10x faster, in the teacher's style. \r\n\r\nTeachers often spend hours of their own time grading hundreds of papers, which can lead to rushed and generic feedback for students. \r\n\r\nUnlike other grading tools that require bulk uploads and remove teachers from the process, VibeGrade allows teachers to use AI to write high-quality, teacher-like feedbackâ€”right within the LMS.",
