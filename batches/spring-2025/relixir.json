  "long_description": "Relixir is the content automation platform for AI search visibility.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in 20 years, google search has dipped below a 90% market share. This is because people are switching to AI search.\r\n\r\nHowever, old SEO content only works for Google, leaving teams helpless as their customers turn to AI assistants for answers and recommendations that leave them out.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s where Relixir comes in to automatically discover, write, and update GEO content that pushes companies to be the answer on ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.",
