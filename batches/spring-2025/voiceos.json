  "long_description": "VoiceOS turns voice into a seamless, universal interface for reading and writing. It works in any app, letting users speak naturally to compose, edit, and understand text anywhere — email, Slack, Notion, Chrome, or Word. It doesn’t just transcribe; it refines, rewrites, and explains — transforming speech into clear, polished writing and static text into dynamic understanding. The result is a faster, more human way to think and communicate.",
