  "long_description": "The rapidly growing creator economy ($250B+) consists of millions of solo entrepreneurs still managing complex business finances with spreadsheets and a patchwork of disconnected tools. They face volatile multi-source income, unique business expenses, and daunting U.S. tax obligations: leading to significant stress, lost time, and missed financial opportunities.\r\n\r\nBeluga Labs is building the financial operating system for these modern solopreneurs. Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.",
