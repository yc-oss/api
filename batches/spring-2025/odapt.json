  "long_description": "Odapt lets anyone build AI-powered internal software using plain language. We connect all your apps and internal data into one place - giving our AI agents the cross-system awareness most tools lack. Operators, marketers, and finance leads can now prompt Odapt to design and ship context-specific tools in minutes, without any engineering bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nWe believe software should be built by the people who use it. Teams already use Odapt to unify sales data, automate documentation, and run recruiting ops—all without writing a line of code. With AI, we’re unlocking 10x more builders inside companies - and giving them the tools to create what they need, when they need it.\r\n\r\nOur team has deep roots in AI, ops, and product:\r\nLucas worked on code-gen at OpenAI and bootstrapped to $1M ARR.\r\nEnde deployed AI safety across 20M+ devices and was part of Stanford’s NLP lab.\r\nMadhav was an operator at McKinsey and founding BizOps lead at a recruiting startup.\r\n\r\n",
