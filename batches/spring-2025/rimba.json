Rimba offers a platform that integrates data from various software systems—like ERPs, SCADA, Sharepoint—to monitor, report, and verify emissions and other environmental data. Rimba has the capability to parse through PDFs and time-series data at scale while having an AI that continuously learns and predicts outcomes.",
