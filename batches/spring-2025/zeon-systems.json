  "long_description": "We’re building AI-powered systems that automate manual work in scientific labs using robotics.\r\n\r\nScientists simply type their experiment in plain English. Zeon translates it into code and runs it on robotic arms (no coding required).\r\n\r\nBy controlling robots with natural language, we’re enabling automation for every lab, every scientist, and every experiment.\r\n\r\nZeon is lab-aware. It detects equipment, adapts to protocols, and moves autonomously between instruments to execute full workflows.\r\n\r\nWe’re already working with labs at Stanford and UCSF to accelerate discovery - from running overnight nanoparticle fluorescence measurements to safely disposing of hundreds of bacterial samples. \r\n\r\nZeon reclaims time for what matters most: the science.",
