  "long_description": "Saffron Health is building AI agents that automate specialist referrals for primary care. \r\n\r\nPrimary care staff spend hours each day on tedious coordination work: searching for in-network specialists, filling out authorization forms, and chasing down medical records.\r\n\r\nSaffron's agents find available in-network providers, complete prior authorizations, and help patients book appointments, which lowers administrative costs and improves access to care.\r\n",
