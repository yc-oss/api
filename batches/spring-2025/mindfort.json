  "long_description": "MindFort is building fully autonomous AI agents powered by their in-house models that can find, exploit, and patch complex vulnerabilities in web applications at massive scale. MindFort agents use the same principles as human penetration testers to understand their target and figure out the best ways to work together to exploit it.\r\n\r\nWhile security teams were already behind with legacy tools and processes, AI coding is make the problem worse. AI generates code far faster than human teams can secure it; MindFort can match that speed and scale. Our agents will become critical as organizations scale up development with AI.\r\n",
