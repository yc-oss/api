  "long_description": "Ticket Wallet is an AI-powered resale platform for season ticket holders and brokers.\r\nWe automate pricing, listing, and distribution across all major marketplaces.\r\n\r\nToday, most tickets are still sold manually: spreadsheets, guessing prices, and listing on one site at a time. The biggest brokers outsource pricing to teams in the Philippines… \r\n\r\nWe built Ticket Wallet because we lived this. Truman has been flipping tickets for the last 5 years. Ryan built pricing software after seeing the mess first-hand. We’ve turned that pain into a product.\r\n\r\nSince launch, we’ve onboarded $3M+ in ticket inventory, signed up 100+ paying sellers, and started working with pro teams. We charge 10% per ticket sold. This is our wedge into the $26B resale market.\r\n\r\nOther platforms cost you money. We make you more of it.",
