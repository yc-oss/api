  "long_description": "sieve solves data cleaning for hedge funds and investment firms by letting them get clean data in four lines of code. Currently, their data pipelines have conditions that raise for human review, which literally send an email to engineers with data that needs to be reviewed. We provide an API that integrates directly into their existing pipeline - instead of raising for human review, they can send all the same information to our API and get clean, high-quality data back.\r\n\r\nBy using our AI agents built specifically for financial data collection, along with expert-in-the-loop review, we provide our clients with clean, validated data at a scale and level of quality that wasn't achievable before.",
