  "long_description": "RunRL improves LLMs and AI agents with reinforcement learning. Do you have a model that needs to get better at a certain task? Are you tired of messing around with prompts? Do you spend a lot of money on observability, and wish that all this data could let your model self-improve? Well, head on over to RunRL.com, and see what we have to offer! If you give us a model, a prompt, and a reward, we’ll make your model’s reward go up.",
