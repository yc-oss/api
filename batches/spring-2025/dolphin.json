  "long_description": "Dolphin is a startup in a box. Dolphin is a web-app builder for aspiring startup founders to ship to their first customers in an hour. \r\n\r\nDolphin builds startups in one pass. Dolphin can setup subscriptions, AI assistants, complicated database updates, integrations, messaging, and more. \r\n\r\nTeddy and I have spent thousands of hours building complicated web apps, and we’ve developed strong opinions on how to architect them. That’s why Dolphin is so powerful: rather than give an AI free rein, we constrain it to the Dolphin architecture. Constraints breed creativity. We designed the Dolphin architecture so that, when an AI works with it, its outputs are correct, secure, and scalable.  ",
