  "long_description": "We're 2 repeat YC founders. We founded Plato (W16, sold to Coda) and Wolfia (S22). Quang lead Product/GTM for Coda Solutions and Fabien is ex-SWE at Meta and lead Engineering at Wealthfront before.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™re building Vybe: \"Lovable for internal apps\". We come with pre-built building blocks: Integrations (Gmail, Gcal, Github, Jira, etc.), SSO and AI tools (Websearch, Summarization etc.) so anyone in a company can build and launch internal AI-powered apps.\r\n\r\nVibe coding is dramatically lowering the barrier for non-technical users to create full web apps. Lovable, Replit, Bolt, Google, Canva, Figma all launched their vibe-coding platforms. People love them. They're great for prototyping, but it's difficult to roll out inside a company for internal use cases for those reasons: \r\n\r\n1. Data: If you want to connect your existing data (e.g. Salesforce, Gmail, Jira), you'd need to rebuild the API auth, pagination, etc. \r\n\r\n2. SSO: If you build 20 apps, you'll have 20 different logins\r\n\r\n3. Security: AI-built apps have massive risk of exposing data, especially if built by non developers\r\n\r\nSo companies are stuck in the old world: clunky spreadsheets, rigid SaaS solutions or complex no-code tools.\r\n\r\nTime to build!
