  "long_description": "We’re building agents for in-house legal teams, starting with media/entertainment. Our customers use Third Chair to discover IP infringements, collect evidence, and recover millions of dollars in damages.\r\n\r\nWe’re both second-time, exited YC founders with deep domain expertise in this market. My last startup sold marketing analytics to Universal Music Group and Mr. Beast. My cofounder Shourya founded a fintech platform and scaled it to 2 million users and tens of millions in transactions. \r\n\r\nAI will enable the first one-person unicorn. Third Chair will be their legal team. ",
