  "long_description": "QualGent is an AI Mobile App Quality Assurance Tester that mimics a real human, helping teams catch bugs and ship faster - without hiring more QA testers. One customer reached #3 in the Education category on the App Store by improving app quality with QualGent.\r\n\r\nMobile bugs hurt: crashes kill ratings, broken checkouts drive churn. QualGent helps teams scale QA effortlessly and avoid Sonos-level disasters.\r\n\r\nThe idea for QualGent was born from the founders’ experience leading engineering teams at Google across Android XR, Stadia, Quick Share, and foldable devices where shipping to billions of users meant constantly facing the painful trade-off between moving fast and maintaining quality. With prior research experience at Nvidia, Maryland, and Berkeley, the team saw a clear opportunity: use AI to scale QA.\r\n\r\nQualGent’s vision is to close the loop on software creation. As AI enables engineers to code 100x faster, QualGent eliminates the next bottleneck—software verification—unlocking truly scalable, end-to-end software development.",
