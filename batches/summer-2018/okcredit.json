  "long_description": "Today, over 50 million SMBs issue informal credit in India, This is a hugely manual process which they spend hours tracking, reconciling, and collecting! \r\n\r\nThe 50M SMBs in India account for 40% of the nation’s GDP. As much as 60% of their sales happen on credit. That’s ~24% of the country’s GDP (500B$) lying on paper!\r\n\r\nOKCREDIT as a company came into existence to start solving the most important problem of credit recovery in MSMEs. We as first movers developed a bookkeeping app that would help any merchant sitting at the remotest corner of the country with internet connectivity to record his transactions digitally. We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers. So as a company our vision was to bring the data dark merchants onto the digital platform. We have changed the way the MSMEs record the transactions and eased their life today. \r\n\r\n",
