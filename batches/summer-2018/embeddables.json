  "long_description": "We replace form builders like Typeform and custom code as the way you collect information from users using low code tools. For example you’re a health tech startup and want an onboarding flow but don’t want to use Typeform and don’t have engineering bandwidth. You can use Embeddables to build a totally custom concierge flow and embed it in your app. Then make edits and view analytics, without writing code.",
