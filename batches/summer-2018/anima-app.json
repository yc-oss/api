No Figma skills required. Anima generates clean and developer-friendly code. So your prototypes could also be used for handoff.\r\n\r\nThree ways to start\r\n- Figma to Code → Instantly generate clean React, HTML, or Vue code from Figma designs.\r\n- Website to Code (Cloning / Remixing) → Import any live website and turn it into editable code.\r\n- Prompt to Design (coming soon) → Generate high-end UI directly from natural language prompts, automatically styled to your brand.\r\n\r\nKey features\r\n- Start at AnimaApp.com to bring your design or your website to Anima\r\n- Chat in Anima playground to iterate on your project's code while staying on-brand\r\n- Handoff playground link to engineering\r\n- Or, download code to continue with Clause code ot Cursor\r\n- Or, publish a public link to share with clients or stakeholders",
