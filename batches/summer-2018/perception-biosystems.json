  "long_description": "Perception Biosystems is democratizing gene therapy through lab automation. Our mission is to accelerate the clinical translation of gene therapy by reinventing its manufacturing and development processes.\r\n\r\nWe're building a robotic lab in the SF Bay Area to translate the large facilities, labor, and regulatory requirements of current gene therapy factories into automated flexible manufacturing systems and code. This enables us to produce gene therapies for use in human clinical trials an order of magnitude faster and cheaper than the current solution – opening up thousands of rare disease targets otherwise thought too rare to pursue.",
