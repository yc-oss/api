  "long_description": "Calii is building the future of grocery shopping in LatAm by delivering ultra-fresh produce and thousands of grocery items in less than two hours– with savings and less waste!\r\n\r\nFounded by Stanford engineers, Calii is taking a full-stack, tech-driven approach connecting directly with producers and brands, automating the food supply chain end-to-end, and delivering to users’ doorsteps via a network of micro-fulfillment centers. By cutting middlemen and inefficiencies in the food supply chain, users get ultra-fresh groceries with savings, meanwhile helping the environment by reducing waste by up to 3X.\r\n\r\nEven though COVID-19 increased the use of grocery delivery apps, grocery shopping remains largely offline (~95%) and represents a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Calii is already cracking the $1T groceries market in its path to become the next-gen Amazon in LatAm.",
