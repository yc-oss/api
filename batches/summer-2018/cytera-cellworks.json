  "long_description": "Mytos builds robots for manufacturing human cells. Operators input stem cells, and our platform turns them into specific cells such as neurons and heart cells over multiple weeks.\r\n\r\nLast year, patients were cured of Parkinson’s, vision loss, and Type 1 diabetes using stem-cell derived cells. We need 1000x the global capacity to produce these cells, and treat millions of patients. But today these Regenerative Medicines are produced by hand, meaning they’re too expensive and don’t scale.\r\n\r\nMytos has fully automated production of these cells, making it scalable. We have our first manufacturing deal - neurons for treating Parkinson’s - and we’re in conversations with majority of the other top players.",
