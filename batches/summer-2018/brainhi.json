  "long_description": "BrainHi is an automated receptionist for local businesses.  Local businesses are in search of new clients and revenue, yet 25% of phone calls to local businesses are missed and 80% of potential clients donâ€™t leave voicemails.\r\n\r\nBrainHi uses AI to create an automated receptionist that answers  missed calls 24/7 and chats with clients to schedule appointments and answer admin questions, resulting in more business. Cofounders Emmanuel and Israel started BrainHi after Hurricane Maria made communicating with doctors offices nearly impossible on the island of Puerto Rico.\r\n",
