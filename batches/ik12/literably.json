  "long_description": "Literably is a literacy assessment system that screens K-8 students for reading difficulties, monitors their progress as readers, and diagnoses skill gaps. Literably's mobile and web apps allow schools to administer assessments online that otherwise are administered manually. As a result, teachers can spend much less time testing and more time teaching.",
