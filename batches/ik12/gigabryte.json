Our mission is to put more learners on the ramp towards further STEM and computing experiences by giving kids the chance to code the things they love!\n\nGigaBryte introduces late elementary school kids to programming. The platform consists of a drag-and-drop visual programming environment; a wearable device that enables kids to bring their programs into the real world; and an online community where children can share their creations and remix the programs of others. We are also developing a curriculum to introduce fundamental computer science concepts like loops, conditionals, variables, procedures, and more through video tutorials.",
