  "long_description": "To help K-12 educators use data to analyze the past, understand the present, and anticipate the future.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nK-12 districts collect an enormous amount of student data. Educators now recognize that data can inform decisions that improve student outcomes, but few are equipped to make sense of data in a timely manner. Efforts to be “data-driven” require costly software, time-consuming setup, and extensive training. The resulting reports, which are often complex and outdated, fail to provide the information needed for daily decision-making.\n\nWHAT IS LEARNSPROUT?\n\nLearnSprout is an online data insights service for K-12 educators. It is the only education analytics solution available that uses live data directly from a district’s student information system. LearnSprout combines assessment results, course grades, and attendance to provide actionable insights into student and school performance. Supported by simple setup, and clear, purposeful design, LearnSprout creates an experience that engages and informs.",
