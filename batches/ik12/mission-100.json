  "long_description": "Teachers across the country are working daily to improve their practice in order to help their students grow. Research has proven that observation of those who are experts in their craft (teaching and otherwise) leads to more efficient and effective growth.\n\nAt Mission 100% they do the hard work for school leaders and instructional coaches, traveling around the country and identifying those experts in all content areas, grades K-12. They film their classrooms and then edit that footage down into short, targeted clips that name and spotlight exactly what they're doing to get results. These clips are aligned to a framework that makes it easy for school leaders and instructional coaches to search and find the exact clips that will best support them in developing their teachers.\n\nNext, they further curate the library to build collections of clips, targeting specific skills and providing on-demand development using real teachers from actual classrooms.",
