MathChat enables them to easily input their math and get help in real time from whoever they trust, including friends, family and teachers. Students can easily enter their math using an optimized math keyboard, and then those helping can view their work in real time and guide the student through pointing and messaging. MathChat can be used to promote student math collaboration in any setting, including the classroom and during tutoring. To learn more visit getmathchat.com.",
