  "long_description": "Kodable Education was founded to fill a gap in education currently affecting over 250 million kids around the world.  Our mission is to help prepare kids for success in the 21st century by making programming education accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWe make awesome games that not only teach kids about programming, but help develop soft skills like grit, perseverance, and problem solving. Kids journey through the Smeeborgian Universe with a family of furry aliens and learn about programming logic, JavaScript, and game design. Kodable also includes a curriculum for elementary school teachers so they can feel confident teaching along side the game. \r\n\r\nKodable is already used in over 50% of US schools, and in over 190 countries. Help us continue our mission and expose millions more kids to the wonderful world of computer science!",
