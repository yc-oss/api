It provided quizzes, psychological tests developed by PhD's, social networking, matchmaking, photo sharing, and an ad network called Grapevine. Tickle registered over 150 million people before 2005.\n\nTickle survived the dot-com bubble burst of 2000, raised just one round of $9M, became profitable in early 2002, was acquired by Monster Worldwide in May 2004 for $110M including earnout, and became part of the overall Monster network for 4 years before being shut down by Monster on December 31, 2008.",
