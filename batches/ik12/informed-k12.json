  "long_description": "At Informed K12, we’re on a mission to help school district administrators operate efficiently and gain insight into their most critical school business processes. Still today, most school districts have hundreds of mission critical processes that run on paper, making visibility and improvement near impossible.\r\n\r\nWe transform paperwork from a daily stumbling block to a strategic tool. This makes it possible to hire the right teachers faster, manage bus routes for students without permanent housing, ensure teachers get reimbursed and paid on time, and a lot more. We are powering the future of school district operations by helping district administrators drive the systemic change needed to improve productivity, accountability and equity.",
