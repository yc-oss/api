  "long_description": "Our mission is simple: ensure every student gets a world-class education.\r\n\r\nEvery classroom has students at many different levels. In fact, close to 75% of classrooms have students with reading levels that span across more than four grade levels!\r\n\r\nYet, most teachers are only provided with resources that teach one specific level. To overcome this, teachers work nights and weekends to find the perfect piece of content for each of their students. Then, during the day, they work with their classes in small groups so they can personalize their instruction as best they can.\r\n\r\nTeachers are doing this all on their own and they deserve our help.\r\n\r\nThat’s why, at Freckle, we provide teachers the resources and data they need to teach all of their students at the level that’s best for them.",
