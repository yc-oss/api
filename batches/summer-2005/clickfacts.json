  "long_description": "ClickFacts is a Malware Software Solutions company for buyers and sellers of online media. Its automated plug and play malware discovery solution tests online ads (SWFs & 3rd Party Ad Tags) and web pages within websites to ensure they do not distribute malware onto usersâ€™ computers (which can lead to identity theft). Its moderation software solution monitors websites to ensure the ads running on them are free of inappropriate content (e.g., nudity, racism), and its Ad Buddy product provides to advertisers real-time continuous monitoring and a complete history of where their ads have run. ClickFacts Inc. was founded in 2005 by Mikhail Ledvich, Mikhail Gurevich, and Greg Gurevich in Boston Mass, with initial funding by YCombinator. It is now based in San Francisco, California.",
