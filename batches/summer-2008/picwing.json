  "long_description": "Picwing is a photo sharing platform that enables users to share their photos through a variety of sources.\r\n\r\nPicwing offers a convenient printing service where their users can send photos through email using a camera or computer. These photos are printed and mailed to one or more recipients every 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nPicwing also provides digital photo frames built upon a Linux kernel. Users can send an image from their desktop or phone, and within 20-30 seconds see it on a digital frame. The frames are mini Linux machines that the founders hope will eventually be able to support much more than image sharing.",
