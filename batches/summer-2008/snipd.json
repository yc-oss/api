  "long_description": "Grab pieces of enjoyable content from any page, save them online, and share without having to copy/paste using a simple bookmarklet. For bloggers and media sites, Snipd's widget enables readership to Snip images, videos, or text enjoyed most within articles.\n\nSnipd content becomes a destination for users, rather than a list of bookmarks because users are able to enjoy what they saved from within pages on the net.\n\nWith more and more content to sift through these days, Snipd makes it easier to identify hot-zones in articles. Hot-zones are dumbed-down heat maps for content. Readers can forget skimming and focus on what people are Snipping most on any page. Because a snip is an implicit vote on a piece of content, we aggregate and figure out what area of an article is attracting the most attention.",
