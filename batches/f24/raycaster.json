  "long_description": "Raycaster helps companies sell complex technical products by surfacing hidden insights about their prospects. Our customers use us to automatically uncover everything from lab equipment specifications to API performance metrics - research that traditionally took weeks of manual digging.\r\n\r\nWhat's exciting is how these insights naturally spread. Teams start with BD, then realize their marketing or product teams need this deep customer understanding too. We're building the intelligence layer that helps technical teams make better decisions.",
