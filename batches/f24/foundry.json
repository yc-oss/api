  "long_description": "We’re building the an end-to-end web simulator for browser agent training and evals. Our system enables teams to test, benchmark, and optimize browser automation models at scale.\r\n\r\n- Deterministic Web Simulation → Stable, reproducible testing with versioned web snapshots.\r\n- Live Web Evaluation → Identify failures caused by UI drift, captchas, and dynamic content.\r\n- Automated Annotation & Labeling → Generate high-quality training data for benchmarking.\r\n- RL-Driven Agent Optimization → Improve models with scalable, feedback-driven learning.\r\n\r\nBy combining synthetic user simulations, automated evaluations, and large-scale benchmarking, we help teams build more reliable web agents that handle real-world environments with confidence.",
