  "long_description": "We built Gecko for teams that want to build secure code quickly without wasting time on security tools that donâ€™t deliver results, or relying on one-time human pentests that quickly become outdated. Gecko uses AI to understand how your application should work, simulates relevant attacks to find critical vulnerabilities, and then verifies these vulnerabilities by exploiting them. It also helps you understand the risk of these vulnerabilities and applies a working fix to keep your code secure.",
