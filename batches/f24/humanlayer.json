  "long_description": "HumanLayer is an API that enables AI applications to contact humans for help, feedback, and approvals. One customer uses HumanLayer to ship DevOps agents that manage complex and risky workflows like production deployments and database migrations. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe’re building HumanLayer because we know that the future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is “outer loop” or “headless” agents, and our partners are building AI apps that invert the typical interaction paradigm. Autonomous agents are calling humans, not the other way around.\r\n\r\n\r\nAI Agents are poised to disrupt the $4.6tn global labor market, but in order to make agents reliable today, and train them to be fully autonomous tomorrow, solutions like HumanLayer are an inevitable part of the AI Agent stack.
