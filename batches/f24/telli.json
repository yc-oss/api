  "long_description": "telli is building AI voice agents that convert leads into sales opportunities for B2C companies. For example, a leading home-buying platform is using telli to fully automate their pre-qualification.\r\n\r\nWe are serving customers in energy, real estate, medical products, and home services.\r\n\r\nYou might think that these B2C companies want to do more self-serve and less outreach. But the truth is outbound calls are what really drive conversion. Historically, managing these calls has been complex and expensiveâ€”costing companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. With telli, for the first time, B2C companies can automate the role of a pre-sales agent, end to end.",
