  "long_description": "Upshift is a platform for software companies to build their entire developer ecosystem, including things like OAuth delegated access, third-party app management, and more.\r\n\r\nUp until now, only the biggest companies have had the resources to build these types of systems because it can take years and massive upfront engineering investment to ship something. We cut the time-to-production down to weeks. And this will open up previously inaccessible possibilities for mid-sized businesses and fast-growing startups.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know how to build it. For more than six years, Adam and Thomas have worked together as eng leaders, mastering our system integration expertise from Palantir and Candid Health. Our biggest win included converting an $823 million contract vehicle for the US Army, overhauling their entire data fabric.",
