  "long_description": "Every Origami Agent works like a dedicated human sales rep, analyzing websites, press releases, and product pages to bring you the top 1% of your customers every day.\r\n\r\nUse thousands of Origami Agents to make sense of the other 99% of data that's not in structured databases.\r\n‎ \r\nPreviously, Finn built custom outbound solutions, while Kenson was the CTO at an enterprise sales startup. We found ourselves building this tool for our customers over and over again, and that it worked 10x better than all other outbound strategies.\r\n‎ \r\nThere’s enough information on the internet to know exactly who your perfect customers are.",
