  "long_description": "Chorrie is a no-code platform that puts AI in the hands of medical billing teams to prevent denied and under-billed insurance claims.  We use LLMs to empower billing teams to turn their manual claim QA into automated correctness checks.  Co-founders Chris and Jorrie are MIT computer science grads and went on to work at Google, where they used similar applied AI techniques to automate content moderation workflows and prevent real-world threats.  Within a month of launching with our first client, an ophthalmology practice with 8 clinics and 4 surgery centers, Chorrie has already flagged over $300k of claims that were either under-billed, or would've been denied.
