  "long_description": "Pearson builds AI agents to automate corporate transactions. Large law firms use us to run gigantic books of businesses with AI, reducing their cost of delivery 40-60%. We work with Orrick as our first design partner, starting with M&A due diligence and financings. $3-6T dollars flow through corporate transactions a year and lawyers take home 1-3% as their cut for every transaction ($150B / year). In the long run, we will capture 50% of the corporate transaction market with the top 30 law firms. We will then provide our AI to companies so they can execute these transactions themselves.",
