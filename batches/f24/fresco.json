  "long_description": "Fresco helps construction superintendents take 1000s of pages of notes, 10x faster. We automate the process of completing progress notes and punch lists, reducing time requirements from hours to minutes. Superintendents simply record videos of their site walk, and Fresco pulls out the relevant information and formats it into rich reports. We also offer one-click integrations with leading project management software like Procore and ACC, for maximum usability.",
