  "long_description": "Chat with Manicode to edit your codebase. It's like a junior engineer at your command, but faster! Get it now:\r\n```\r\n> npm install -g manicode\r\n```\r\nRun `manicode` from your project directory. It will read and write to files in your project to produce the code you want.\r\n\r\nManicode is different from all the other coding agents, we swear!\r\n\r\nWhy it's cool:\r\n- **It chooses files to read automatically on each message** — unlike Cursor’s composer feature. This saves you time and makes Manicode respond more comprehensively.\r\n- **It takes 0 clicks** — type your instructions and Manicode will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!\r\n- **It has full access to your terminal** — Manicode can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Manicode is an engineer working for you.",
