It was one of the first gamified fitness apps]\r\n\r\n* Track your motion\r\n\r\nUsing the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.\r\n\r\n* Celebrate progress with friends\r\n\r\nFriends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.\r\n\r\n* Discover a new way to stay motivated\r\n\r\nThe more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. Unlock new content as you progress.\r\n\r\n* Stay active wherever, whenever\r\n\r\nNo more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat.",
