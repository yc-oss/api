Discover, share and work on hardware.\n\nUnlike existing design tools, which are isolated and single user, Upverter is highly integrated, inherently collaborative and accessible anywhere in the world. With Upverter design teams, contract designers and grassroots innovators are leveraging existing design content and focus on building next generation hardware instead of wasting time duplicating work, sourcing parts or dealing with manufacturers.",
