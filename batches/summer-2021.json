We do so by buying loans in small quantities at first and rewarding our customers with more access to capital based on performance. Co-founder & CEO, Vladimir Korshin, previously worked in the traditional venture debt system at Silicon Valley Bank, where he noticed that strong startups were frequently denied from non-dilutive financing because they were too small. Just 4 weeks after going live with our first customer, we purchased $1.3M in loans across 6 customers. The founding team brings 30+ years of startup experience: Vladimir previously worked as an operator at Facebook, Eventbrite, and Niantic; Asa Schachar was an engineer at Microsoft and managed teams of engineers at Optimizely; Molly Hogan led new and international product initiatives at Amazon for over 7 years.

Our platform has all of the same elements as a human immune system, meaning you can test drugs and vaccines as if you were testing them in actual patients from the start. The biggest reason why 95% of new drugs fail is that they were tested in mice - but with our human platform, pharma companies will know which drugs will successfully treat patients, speeding up the process and reducing the cost. To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases. The company is founded by Robert DiFazio, a former Stanford R&D director with a PhD in immunology, and Juliana Hilliard, a former System1 Biosciences R&D lead with an MSc in bioengineering, both of whom have led drug discovery programs for years.",

    "long_description": "At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone.\r\n\r\nAlmost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",

We've also added some unique features that tie in various business functions, allowing us to realize significant efficiencies compared to other players. Our platform is managed by ShipBlu AutoPilot - our collection of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms that constantly make operational predictions and decisions to reduce costs, meet delivery constraints, and refine our operating assumptions. Designed by ShipBlu's CTO, Abdelrahman is currently completing his PhD at Brown University where he explores the applications of AI and ML in optimization problems.\r\n\r\nWe built a nationwide delivery network in Egypt in about 2.5 months, kicking off operations on Aug 1st, 2021.

In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\n✅ Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

    "long_description": "In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy—a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.\r\n\r\nOur Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.\r\n\r\nImpact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.\r\n\r\nRecognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company—it’s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.\r\n ",

The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

Omnivore is faster, cheaper, and more practical than electric propulsion while being substantially less expensive, safer, and more operationally flexible than legacy chemical propulsion systems. Our Sutter Telescope System can identify and locate resource-rich asteroids and orbital debris that existing technologies can’t find and works synergistically with our Worker Bee OTV for orbital logistics. For government customers, Sutter can identify dark fast-moving objects between Earth and the Moon which currently evade detection, a critical issue for national defense and a key need of the Space Force. We are already using Sutter in ground-based observatories and will begin commercial sales of Sutter SDA data next month having tracked dozens of faint moving objects in space already. Once launched into space, Sutter will be 300,000 times more cost effective than any other known telescope design and will revolutionize sense making in space.",

Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

    "long_description": "Tenyks (YC S21) is a Cambridge University spin-out building the World's Most Versatile Visual Intelligence Platform—think Snowflake for Vision or GPT for Video.\r\n\r\nProblem: Companies today collect oceans of visual data (from cameras, drones, and satellites), but struggle to extract actionable insights. Current solutions rely heavily on manual analysis by call centres in locations like the Philippines or AI platforms narrowly focused on security rather than deeper operational insights. This leaves critical improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth unrealised.\r\n\r\nSolution: Tenyks unlocks unprecedented insights by applying advanced multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of comprehensive video summarisation, retrieval, and visual question-answering. These VLMs are seamlessly combined with specialised analytics for emotion detection, activity recognition, object tracking, and even gait analysis. Our platform transforms ordinary visual footage into extraordinary operational intelligence.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus: Starting with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), we enable operations leaders to instantly understand customer flow, kitchen efficiency, staff productivity, and quality of service using their existing security camera footage—turning previously inaccessible data into direct operational improvements and clear financial ROI. For instance, insights from Tenyks can accelerate the speed of service significantly; even a 1-second improvement in service speed could generate $30,000 additional annual revenue per restaurant. For a multi-unit owner of 100 restaurants, that's an additional $3 million per year.\r\n\r\nTraction: We've recently secured our first Fortune 500 customer, joining other major enterprises, global system integrators, and high-growth startups trusting Tenyks for powerful, data-driven decision-making.\r\n\r\nWhy Tenyks: Our patented technology originates from the founders' PhD research at Cambridge University. Previously, we helped world-leading teams scale high-performing Vision AI in production. \r\n\r\nRecognition: Recognised as a Rising Star in Gen AI by Sifted, Best Product of the Year by Vision AI Alliance, and Company of the Year by Cambridge University (previously awarded to DeepMind).",

Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

To get the freshest produce, you need quick producer-to-end-customer delivery, not just quick warehouse-to-customer delivery. Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product. Membo's CEO, Vahur Hansen, was an early engineer at TransferWise, and co-founder, Paula Kink, built her own healthtech startup.

As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",

    "long_description": "When it comes to hiring, there are lots of resources to help managers get more candidates. But on average, only 1 in every 300 of these candidates actually get hired. Hiring managers and recruiters end up taking a robotic, brute force approach to sourcing - the kind of approach top talent hates.\r\n\r\nManagers are increasingly finding that the simplest and most personable way to attract talent starts with their network. The best candidates want to work for great people, not faceless companies. Sharing open roles on places like LinkedIn, Slack, and Twitter unlocks enormous potential for a personalized recruiting approach across a curated talent pool, but these referrals are difficult to track across platforms and end up lost in the shuffle. We are changing that.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade building teams at high-growth consumer tech companies like Instacart, Snapchat, and Uber, Maddy Nguyen turned her attention to creating collaborative tools for hiring managers and recruiters to source candidates from a wider range of networks and communities - while staying human.",
