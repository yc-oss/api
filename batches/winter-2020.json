With Loop, employers can offer a more engaging health benefit that includes doctor visits and telemedicine, alongside traditional hospital coverage, for about the same price.

Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.\r\n\r\nOur Technology and Approach\r\nWe have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\r\n",

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors.",

We demonstrate a reduction in fibrosis with our drug, but more significantly, we show a reversal in fibrotic tissue back to normal tissue. \r\n\r\nWith our current developmental strategy, we hope to have a clinic-ready compound by the end of 2021 and be in phase I clinical trials by mid of 2022. \r\n",

This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",

We are accelerating the global take-up of GLP-1 medications by increasing their accessibility to help solve obesity worldwide.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\r\n\r\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >40x since Aug 2023. We’re serving >50k customers with high NPS. We’re >$100M/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023.\r\n\r\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started.

At goDutch, we are passionately working towards re-imagining this multi-step process that extends over numerous days and multiple apps.

With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.\r\n\r\nWe're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.\r\n\r\nPotentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. \r\n\r\nMore interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe acquire customers at minimal CAC by bank partnerships. We leverage the banks' existing users, by integrating with their mobile app. In turn, we invest into their mutual funds.\r\n\r\nOur long-term vision is to become a one-stop asset management solution for millennials.",

We also provide users with a credit card secured by their investments. \r\n\r\nWe launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who’ve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. \r\n\r\nHere’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. \r\n\r\nHowever, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor.",

The program is delivered remotely over the phone and through the mobile app, therefore users are able to follow the lifestyle program from the convenience of their home. Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.\r\n\r\nThe user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.\r\n\r\nOur unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.\r\n\r\nBreathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot.",

Designed as a \"virtual technician,\" Juno observes device interfaces, reasons over contextual data, and executes actions in a closed-loop system, automating calibration, workflow execution, and optimization without any cloud dependency, internet access, or external APIs. This architecture draws inspiration from agents like ManusAI and Microsoft Copilot's Computer Use Agent (CUA), adapting their observation-reasoning-execution paradigms to treat medical device UIs as controllable \"virtual desktops,\" but confines all processing to edge hardware for compliance with stringent medical safety standards and operational reliability in disconnected environments.",

This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.\r\n\r\nFor decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does.

We plan to expand across the APAC region..\r\n\r\nOur sweet spot is backing repeatable business spend - expenses that leads to increased revenue. Our financing product allows businesses to keep growing with us over time. Over a third of our advances today are from repeat borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe created a brand new asset class in Asia - offering flexible repayment options, such as tieing repayment with sales. Business owners LOVE this.\r\n\r\nOur automated financial technology platform ingests revenue and alternative data sources that gives us a proprietary edge in understanding the behavior of our borrowers. As we collect continuous data, we are able to offer better financial and technology solutions, while mitigating our downside risk.\r\n\r\nFunds are seamlessly deployed via our virtual Jenfi Wallet and MasterCard solution, giving borrowers flexibility to make payments while giving Jenfi real-time tracking of their spend.\r\n\r\nRecent coverage: \r\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/jenfi-wants-to-solve-small-business-lending-in-southeast-asia/",
