  "long_description": "Docs are integral to a great customer experience, but managing them is a challenging, multi-team effort. The most successful companies recognize that fantastic docs drive adoption and bad ones cause customers to churn. Promptless is used by fast-growing startups and Fortune 500 enterprises alike to automatically update docs based on feature releases, support tickets, internal Slack conversations, and more.\r\n\r\nPromptless is designed to be flexibleâ€”it can integrate with any docs platform, be triggered automatically from many workflows, and can pull in context from any internal knowledge source.\r\n\r\nWith Promptless, documentation becomes a strategic advantage for growth, not a bottleneck or a liability.
