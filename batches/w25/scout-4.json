  "long_description": "The student information system (SIS) is the core system of record in every K-12 school. It tracks students, attendance, grades, schedules, staff, and more - kind of like the ERP for schools.\r\n\r\nLegacy SIS providers do just about that, and not much more. School districts layer dozens of tools on top of their SIS to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nScout is an AI-powered student information system that automates school- and district-wide busywork, from day-to-day operations like attendance tracking to annual compliance reports. Our mission is to help school districts run like high-performing organizations, enabling them to provide high-quality, personalized instruction to every student.",
