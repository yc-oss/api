  "long_description": "Augento is the platform for DeepSeek R1 (like) fine tuning as a service. A user gives us an Agent and where it went wrong and we'll improve it.\r\nWe provide a turn key solution to customers to act on poorly performing agents, by providing feedback in our UI to the agent and we'll take care of improving the model with reinforcement learning.\r\nImagine a startup developing a tool for law firms, enhanced with an AI to assist lawyers in selecting clients. Currently, this startup would face significant challenges in building such a tool, as itâ€™s crucial to provide accurate and consistent responses every time. With our technology, the startup can enhance the initial model by incorporating its own experience and feedback from beta users, eventually surpassing the initial model and delivering reliable results on every query.",
