  "long_description": "Sophris is your AI “engineer” for circuit board schematics, checking for errors—pin mismatches, connectivity gaps, or voltage conflicts—long before they derail your design. By flagging potential issues early, you can fix them ahead of production and avoid the frustrating re-spins that drive up costs and delay schedules.\r\n\r\nWhile traditional EDA tools offer basic ERC and DRC checks—like net connectivity and spacing—they don't dig deeply into component datasheets. Sophris takes it further, analyzing specs and cross-referencing design requirements from multiple sources. As a result, subtle pin misconfigurations, voltage mismatches, and datasheet-specific quirks that typical rule checks might miss are brought to light.\r\n\r\nBy identifying design flaws during the schematic phase, Sophris helps you iterate confidently and deliver more reliable products. Faster turnarounds, fewer production surprises, and a smoother path from concept to manufacturing. With Sophris, design more confidently and ship more reliably.",
