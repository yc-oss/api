  "long_description": "Mesh is building your AI finance co-worker. Mesh is the single, unified interface through which founders can ask questions about their financials, and think through budgeting and forecasting. \r\n\r\nNandini and Erin worked together for 5+ years at Carta, and helped grow the fund accounting business from $20M to $100M ARR. Leveraging their insights from Carta, theyâ€™re now automating accounting and finance for companies. \r\n\r\nAfter talking to 100+ companies, they realized that what companies need is a better finance partner. Our agents will meet founders exactly where they are by integrating with the existing tech stack and being accessible across various communication channels (i.e. Email, WhatsApp, Chat, Phone, Zoom). \r\n\r\nWithin 1 week of launching on ProductHunt, they have taken 25 customers live, and became the #1 Fintech of the Week.\r\n\r\nWith 35M companies in the US spending ~1-3% of their revenues on finance and accounting, we're going after a $175B market opportunity.",
