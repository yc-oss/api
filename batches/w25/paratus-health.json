  "long_description": "Paratus Health began as an AI voice intake nurse that automates pre-appointment patient interviews, saving doctors time and improving clinical accuracy. By conducting dynamic symptom assessments before the visit, it generates structured summaries that help doctors walk in prepared, reducing missed diagnoses and boosting clinic efficiency. Now, we're expanding the platform into AI agents for end-to-end care delivery, automating the most costly and repetitive manual labor across the patient journey. From intake to post-visit follow-up, Paratus Health transforms wasted time into better care, higher ROI, and a scalable solution for modern healthcare.",
