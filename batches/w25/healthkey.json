Big Pharma pays a lot of money to clinics for each patient they enroll, but finding patients who qualify is an entirely manual process today. We use AI to prescreen doctorsâ€™ existing patients against Clinical Trialsâ€™ eligibility criteria, making enrollment fast and easy.\r\n\r\nMeet with Josh (CEO) ðŸ‘‰ https://cal.com/healthkey/15-min-meeting",
