  "long_description": "PAX is a new crypto exchange and is the first – in all capital markets – to operate from a single chip rather than an entire datacenter. PAX moves traders to within nanometers of the exchange – closer than ever before possible.\r\n\r\nSuch proximity unlocks unprecedented value to high frequency customers and PAX shares this value by offering zero-fee with cash-back to every other market participant on every trade. PAX is to exchange as Robinhood was to retail brokerage: the first in the industry to “go to zero” and a complete game changer across every asset and geography.\r\n\r\nPAX founders, Pete and Ben have spent years working as high-frequency traders, from crypto to traditional markets. Having directly experienced the benefit of electronic trading, they share a belief in its potential to further evolve and create better global markets.",
