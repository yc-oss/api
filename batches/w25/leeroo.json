Our platform enables the creation of end-to-end trainable Compound Models that combine pre-trained models, tools, and data seamlessly. Not only do we automate model building but also automate the integration of tools and data sources, accelerating the journey from concept to deployment. By abstracting complexity, we allow users to focus on solving problems, not building infrastructure, and deliver scalable, customizable, and fully private solutions.",
