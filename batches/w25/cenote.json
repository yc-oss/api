  "long_description": "Cenote uses AI to automate the back office for medical practices — eliminating the bottlenecks that often delay patient care and clinic revenue.\r\n\r\nTypically, practices hire teams to manually extract patient info from hundreds to thousands of faxes a week. This slow process risks losing patients to faster competitors. Cenote’s software streamlines this workflow. \r\n\r\nThere are 330,000 medical practices in the U.S Capturing $50,000 per practice presents a $16.5 Billion opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe team behind Cenote—Kofi, Ajani, and Kristy—met in San Francisco and bring deep expertise in building scalable solutions for highly-regulated industries such as climate and gov tech.",
