  "long_description": "Astro finds and buys land for new renewable energy projects, secures grid connections at minimal cost, and sells these development-ready projects to larger energy companies. Founded by Alex Fuster, a former Citadel energy trader, Astro's AI models identify profitable grid connections that eliminate the surprise costs causing 80-90% of renewable projects to fail. With the U.S. needing 2,000 gigawatts of new power generation by 2035 for AI data centers and electrification, Astro unlocks development opportunities that traditional methods consistently miss.",
