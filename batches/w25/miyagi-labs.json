  "long_description": "Miyagi Labs is an AI-powered platform that transforms videos from content creators and professors into complete, interactive courses.\r\n\r\nYouTube is one of the best educational resources in the world, but it lacks the tools to turn passive watching into active learning. By making course creation as simple as uploading a video, we’re building Shopify for online education, empowering content creators and educators to transform their knowledge into engaging, interactive learning experiences.\r\n\r\nWe automatically generate high-quality courses—in under an hour—that people actually complete. On our platform, learners engage with short-answer and multiple-choice questions, as well as quizzes, receiving instant feedback and support from an AI voice tutor if they need more help.",
