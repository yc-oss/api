  "long_description": "Mastra is the easiest way to build a production AI application, built by the team that brought you Gatsby. We provide a complete set of AI primitives: workflows for complex operations, agents for autonomous decisions, RAG for knowledge integration, and evals for quality & accuracy. Mastra is open-source, modular, and built in Typescript for product developers. You can deploy Mastra on any cloud, and it gives you a straightforward syntax to solve the hardest problems building with AI: human-in-the-loop workflows, agent memory and tool selection, and output quality.
