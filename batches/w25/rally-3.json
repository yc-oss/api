  "long_description": "Rally is a financial platform for businesses that operate vehicle fleets. We're starting in Europe, where over â‚¬1 trillion is spent annually on fuel, charging, maintenance, and other fleet expenses - most of it still running on legacy networks built in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWe set a new standard for fleet finance by streamlining payments and automating workflows across bookkeeping, credit, and driver payroll, helping real-world businesses like delivery services, construction crews, and service technicians stay in control and operate efficiently.",
