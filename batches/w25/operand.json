  "long_description": "Operand is building an AI to replace traditional consulting. We help businesses make better decisions by deeply analyzing their data across all sources—something consultants can’t do at scale.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting in e-commerce and retail, where the businesses’ high data density and real-time feedback loops allow us to show impact fast. Our first capability is pricing and discount strategy. Operand considers everything—competitor pricing, ad strategy, inventory, and more—to ensure businesses maximize profit.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike other AI solutions, every Operand result is verified by human experts, including ex-MBB consultants, so you get actual impact, not just AI hype.\r\n\r\nWe’re already generating 6-figure P&L improvements for early customers.",
