  "long_description": "Woz is an AI platform that enables anyone to build and scale real software businesses - no coding required.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the ability to write code and architect software served as a massive barrier to business building. Woz eliminates this barrier with a team of AI agents that enable anyone, regardless of technical ability, to build products, go to market and grow a business all on one platform without a technical cofounder or inhouse engineering team. \r\n\r\nTo start, weâ€™re helping entrepreneurs build high quality mobile apps and launch them directly to the app store. For example, one of our first customers is a personal trainer building a fitness app for his clients. Ultimately, Woz aims to be the default platform where millions of AI-enabled entrepreneurs launch and scale businesses.\r\n\r\nWoz is built by a team of engineers and ML scientists who've worked together building complex AI systems for the last decade. We're backed by YC, Untapped Ventures, MGV and more. ",
