  "long_description": "Dex is the AI copilot built for the browser.\r\n\r\nMost web agents are optimized for \"set-and-forget\" tasks—you hand them off and check back later. But what about the workflows you'd want to drive? Jumping between tabs, browsing sites, filling forms, and searching across apps—these experiences demand instant, context-aware models that work with you, not just for you.\r\n\r\nDex turns your browser into an intelligent workspace that understands your intent. With simple voice and text, it enhances familiar interfaces, automates mundane actions, and helps 10x your productivity on the browser.\r\n\r\nNo more slow handoffs. No more context-switching. Just AI that moves at your speed.",
