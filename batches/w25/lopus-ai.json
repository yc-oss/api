  "long_description": "Sales teams blast emails, spam LinkedIn, and chase leads who were never interested in the first place. Conversion rates are dropping, and buyers are tuning out. The problem isn’t a lack of prospects—it’s that most businesses are looking in the wrong places.\r\n\r\nPeople and businesses talk about their pain points online every day—struggling with problems your product solves. We track these high-intent conversations, surface the right buyers, and deliver them straight to you. Just 20 minutes a day, and you’re engaging with people ready to buy, with conversion rates as high as 50%.\r\n\r\nPeople are looking for your solution - you're just not seeing them. Let's change that.",
