  "long_description": "At ReJot, we're building a synchronization engine to greatly reduce the complexity of data sharing between backend services within enterprises. The traditional approach is Event Streaming, where events are published to a platform like Kafka. Kafka not only requires significant effort to operate, it also forces engineers to use events. Events come with inherent complexityâ€”they encode something happening rather than something being (i.e., state).\r\n\r\nOur approach is based on replication, where state is transferred directly instead of requiring a back-and-forth conversion to events. We provide primitives to enable teams to break data silos, while keeping in mind data ownership and provenance. Teams define what data their backend publishes and requires, and we'll make sure everything is reactively up-to-date. ReJot works on top of existing infrastructure such as Postgres.\r\n",
