  "long_description": "We started Trace because we believe AI should wow customers, not frustrate them. As a result, we prioritize reliability and seamless customer interactions. \r\n\r\nTrace AI agents resolve calls end-to-end, securely integrating with bank systems and external APIs. So far, our agents handle quoting, application, and transaction tracking calls for our partners — but we’re still searching for new exciting use cases.\r\n\r\nQuestion to all fintechs/banks: Which customer requests keep coming back to you? We’d love to learn how you handle them now and if they are ripe for automation. ",
