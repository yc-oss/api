  "long_description": "Roark monitors, evaluates and simulates real customer calls for Voice AI developers. Instead of spending hours manually calling their agent to test changes, teams can instantly simulate real scenarios and catch failures before customers do. \r\n\r\nWithin just 10 days of launching, we signed 8 paying customers, reached $60k in ARR, and began processing over 10,000 calls per week.\r\n\r\nOur team has been building together for over a decade. James previously built AngelListâ€™s portfolio infrastructure supporting its growth from $10B to $124B asset under management, while Daniel was a founding engineer at Akiflow (YC S20) scaling it to $1.5M ARR with 10,000+ customers. \r\n\r\nVoice AI is the future of business calls, but today, teams either fly blind or build in-house solutions because no off-the-shelf tooling exists. Roark solves this, bringing the first real testing and analytics platform to the space.",
