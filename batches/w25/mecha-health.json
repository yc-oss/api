  "long_description": "Mecha Health builds foundation models to automate x-ray analysis for radiologists. We take medical images and process them using proprietary models to produce accurate draft medical reports. Our first model was built in less than two months, and beat Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI on clinical accuracy metrics. On top of that, itâ€™s two orders of magnitude smaller and trained with a quarter of the data.\r\n\r\nWe are partnering with the largest privately owned radiology practice in the US and a multinational tele-radiology company to provide them with their own foundation model, enabling their radiologists to go from reading 1 scan per hour to 1 scan every 5 minutes. By charging on a per scan basis, x-ray report generation represents a 40B+ market opportunity. ",
