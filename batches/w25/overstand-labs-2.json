  "long_description": "If youâ€™re a founder and feel like youâ€”or your exec teamâ€”are too far removed from the customer, Overstand is here to help. Weâ€™re the platform (and API) for your customer communications, turning Slack, emails, WhatsApp, call recordings, and more into actionable insights. For example, we can help you discover feature requests hidden in customer emails, spot upsell opportunities from a casual Slack message, or identify a critical support issue buried in a call transcript -- all without having to depend on others in your company to fill out a form or write meeting notes.\r\n\r\nGet back to Founder Mode by spotting trends, uncovering growth opportunities, and staying deeply connected to your customers. Overstand makes it easy to understand where youâ€™re needed most and take action that drives impact. ðŸš€",
