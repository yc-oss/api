  "long_description": "careCycle is an AI workforce for medicare agencies and FMOs - helping leading agencies achieve 5x higher conversions, 37% better retention, and saving thousands of agent hours.\r\n\r\nWe're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",
