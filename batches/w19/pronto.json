  "long_description": "PRONTO is the first RIDE-SHARING + DELIVERY platform for SECOND-TIER cities in LATAM. \r\n\r\nIn second-tier cities all transactions are paid with cash, this is why the Uber model doesnÂ´t work (since they have to collect their revenue from commissions). We solved this by creating a subscription model where drivers pay a monthly recurring subscription of 59 to 99 USD depending on their monthly revenue. This also generates a higher LTV with low CAC as well as high engagement and fidelity ratios.\r\n\r\nTraction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC.\r\n\r\nMarket Size: There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in LATAM, with more than 500 million people without any access to ride-sharing or technology platforms at all.\r\n",
