  "long_description": "Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs your pipelines in containers. Develop your pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application. Choose your SDK and start coding! Dagger executes your pipelines entirely as standard OCI containers. This has several benefits: - Instant local testing - Portability: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service. - Superior caching: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere - Compatibility with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline. - Cross-language instrumentation: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.",
