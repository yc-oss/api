  "long_description": "PreFlight is a No-code web testing tool for anyone. Preflight is 20x faster than writing Selenium and Cypress tests. Maintaining Selenium/Cypress tests is also a big challenge. Preflight solves this problem by understanding how users understand any page and adapt to the changes and update the selectors if the test passes.\r\n\r\nIt's also super easy to set up end-to-end tests that depend on each other with Preflight's Workflow feature. You can orchestrate which test should run after another.\r\n\r\nCreating API tests has never been so easy. Preflight prepopulates API tests from UI tests' network calls. So, you can set up API tests in minutes. ",
