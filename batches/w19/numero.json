  "long_description": "At Numero, we build software for political campaigns and nonprofits. We were founded in 2019 (after our founders met while working together on a Congressional race) with the goal of building a modern fundraising software suite from the ground up – one that users actually want to use. In that time, we’ve scaled our platform to serve thousands of clients ranging from city council seats to US Senate races, and have helped them collectively manage over $10B in contributions.\r\n\r\nOur platform is an all-in-one system comprised of a donor CRM, a broadcast email/text tool, and payment processing pages that our clients rely on for their work every day. We’re small, tight-knit team that has deep experience in this space and are backed by world class investors including 776, Y Combinator, and Initialized Capital.",
