For example, teams use GoLinks to keep track of their dashboard at go/metrics or an employee directory at go/directory - powered by AI. These internal link systems have been a standard for productivity boost within companies like Google, Yahoo, Linkedin, Twitter, and Airbnb for years. GoLinks is the first company building this as a service for everyone else. 75% of all employees at all of our customers use GoLinks every single month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2023, GoLinks, launched two new productivity solutions to build off of their vision of building a Gen AI productivity suite:\r\n\r\n\r\n- GoSearch (www.gosearch.ai):  An enterprise workplace search solution powered by AI.\r\n\r\n\r\n- GoProfiles (www.goprofiles.io): A hub for your team to find shared connections, celebrate wins, and boost company culture â€” powered by gen AI!",
