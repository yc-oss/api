  "long_description": "Mobot (YC W19) is a QA-as-a-service platform using actual mechanical robots to automate testing of repetitive functions on real mobile devices. Mobot's human-supervised robots make it possible to automate mobile app tests that emulators, virtual devices, and existing frameworks can't. This approach eliminates thousands of hours of manual testing, increases testing efficiency and physical device coverage, and captures more bugs in-app before app store launches than software can do alone.",
