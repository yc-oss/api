  "long_description": "Dusk is the best place to talk and play multiplayer games with your friends. Users hang out on Dusk’s mobile app, sharing laughs on our voice chat as they play amazing indie multiplayer games together! And developers build these games right on the Dusk platform.\r\n\r\nDevelopers leverage the Dusk SDK to build multiplayer games without needing a single line of backend code. They launch their game on Dusk and instantly, thousands of passionate friend groups play it together on voice chat right inside the Dusk app! Dusk’s beta has grown rapidly, with over 50 games built for the platform ranging from multiplayer mini-golf to real-time 3D racing games. The SDK supercharges game creation, with many of our games built in under a week! And these games are played like crazy too — friends have spent over 50 million minutes hanging out and playing our new games together already.",
