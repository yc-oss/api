  "long_description": "Convictional is fundamentally rethinking how business leaders pursue goals and make decisions. Instead of trying to coordinate through email chains, chat messages and meetings with slides, you'll get an entirely new kind of decision environment where the right context and people come together instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour leaders will see every major initiative in motion across the company. They'll spot emerging patterns, tap into experience from past projects, and mobilize the right expertise at the right moment. No hunting for information, no voices lost in the noise, no painful reconstructions of why decisions were made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustom workspaces spin up automatically for each goal. Critical metrics and context from prior decisions will surface proactively. Input will flow from experts inside and outside your company. Everything will be instantly documented. And your team's decision-making playbook will get smarter with every choice you make.",
