  "long_description": "Quad is where college students get things done.\r\n \r\nToday, over 41% of students drop out, 1 in 3 struggle with time management, and 45% end up underemployed because most solutions are ineffective for the modern student. We built Quad to fix this.\r\n\r\nQuad enables students to automatically keep track of their daily coursework, chat with their classmates, and get help - all in one mobile platform. Our proprietary technology transforms assignment information traditionally locked inside the syllabus into dynamic and structured data students utilize daily. \r\n\r\nWe believe that technology with the power to engage students on a daily basis has the ability to fundamentally improve student outcomes.",
