  "long_description": "The amount of time businesses spend on their databases is altogether too much time. Citus is fixing this problem.\r\n\r\nCitus is worry-free Postgres. Built to scale out, Citus is an extension to Postgres that is available as open source, as enterprise software that can be run on-prem or on any cloud, and as a fully-managed database as a service. Whether you have a multi-tenant application that needs to scale out, or you need performance for your real-time analytics customers, with Citus, you can focus on your app—not your database.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2011, Citus Data is venture backed by Khosla Ventures and Data Collective. Citus is a Y Combinator alumnus and has offices in San Francisco’s SoMa district and Istanbul, Turkey.  \r\n\r\nAt Citus, we make it simple to scale out Postgres. \r\n\r\nCitus Data online: www.citusdata.com\r\nDocumentation: docs.citusdata.com\r\nGitHub: github.com/citusdata/citus",
