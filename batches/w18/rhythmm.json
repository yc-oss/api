  "long_description": "Rhythmm is a social app that enables its users to share interesting thoughts and conversations.\r\n\r\nUsers can follow awesome channels and tap through each thought, finding their Rhythmm. They can also create their own channel, invite others to contribute or rock it solo, and the app help with the rest.\r\n\r\nRhythmm wants to take live chat conversations from experts and interesting people and let others follow along. The startup wants to take the insights people are getting from chat groups on Telegram and remove all the noise with their own platform. Only people who have been invited by the chat creator can participate, everybody else just follows the conversations.",
