Under one roof, we bring the best and most powerful podcasts, audiobooks, and meditations from leading minds and experts around the world.\r\n\r\nOur love for podcasts began when we discovered their power to make our ordinary day-to-day tasks more enjoyable and meaningful. Podcasts helped transform tedious activities like commutes or household chores into more positive experiences, helping us learn new skills, stay informed, or pass the time with captivating stories. We want to help people in their pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been podcast aficionados for years, and, even for us, finding the right one to listen to is difficult and frustrating. With tens of millions to choose from and more being released every day, the problem’s only getting worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s time to fix this problem. Americans spend 30 billion hours every year commuting and doing household chores. We want to make those hours worthwhile. By building technology that makes it easy to access great podcasts, we’ll help millions of people reclaim lost time and experience more fun, inspiration, and personal growth every day.\r\n\r\nOur product, Podcast App, is a minimalist podcast player enhanced with cutting-edge technology.
