  "long_description": "We empower mental healthcare clients with virtual reality sessions that are additive to traditional therapy. Clients regain their self-reliance the moment they are given the chance to contribute to their treatment. Therapists can focus on the aspects of treatment that e-health is not equiped to deal with. Treatment efficiency goes up - costs go down: \r\nE-health the way it was meant to be.",
