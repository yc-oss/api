It can be used to store API keys, database credentials, and other application config securely. \r\n\r\nEnvKey makes it easy to grant least-privilege access to the developers and servers that need it from a user-friendly UI. Integration takes minutes.\r\n\r\nUsing EnvKey ensures that no 3rd party, including EnvKey itself, ever has access to your secrets. \r\n\r\nIt takes a part of your system that used to be error-prone and insecure and makes it just work.",
