  "long_description": "Ovipost builds automated insect farms. Insects are the most efficient way to convert abundant, cheap byproducts into nutritionally dense protein. Today live insects are a $175m industry in the US, but the future of the industry is leveraging their excellent amino acid profiles and superior digestibility to replace fishmeal ($9.5B industry) and other expensive proteins in animal feeds. Led by co-founders Trina Chiasson (sold Infoactive to Tableau) and Teq Sassmannshaus (biotech hardware engineer), the Ovipost team has deep experience in hardware, software, and biology. ",
