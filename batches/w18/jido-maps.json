  "long_description": "We help teams that may or may not have machine learning expertise quickly turn their data into deployed computer vision models. Example applications include security camera monitoring, automating data entry, interpreting web scraped images, validated user photo inputs, augmented reality and mobile product scanning. \r\n\r\nIf you have visual or scanned data that you wish your software could interpret at scale, we can turn around a first proof of concept in under a week. Reach out and see how computer vision can change your business.",
