  "long_description": "Tennr is solving the black hole problem in healthcare by leveraging models to digitize the flow of paperwork between healthcare providers.\r\n--\r\nToday, when you go to your doctor and need to be referred to a specialist (e.g., for sleep apnea), your doctor sends a fax (yes, in 2024, 90% of provider-provider communication is a 1980s fax). These are often converted into 20+ page PDFs, with handwritten (doctor’s handwriting!) notes, in thousands of different formats. The problem is so complex that a person has to read it, type it up, and manually enter your information. Tennr built RaeLM™ (7B—trained on 3M+ documents) to read these docs, talk to your doc to ensure nothing is missed, and text you to help schedule your appointment so you can get better, faster.\r\n",
