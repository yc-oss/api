  "long_description": "SelectIQ addresses the primary bottleneck in drug development: recruiting patients into clinical trials.\r\n\r\nWe analyze electronic health records to help doctors find clinical trials for their patients, and to help trial sites find patients for their studies. 72% of doctors want to inform their patients of clinical trials, but only 5% do. We're on a mission to close that gap, ultimately bringing safer, more effective drugs to the patients who need them.",
