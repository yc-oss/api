  "long_description": "Coldreach helps sales teams find ready-to-buy leads, by monitoring public signals *custom* to your product. \r\n\r\nFor example, it can find who's hiring their first accountant, so an accounting automation product can hit them with a targeted message at the right time. \r\n\r\nPublic data sources (job postings, news articles, 10-k reports, etc.) tell a lot about a companyâ€™s priorities and the problems it faces. We train AI sales agents to monitor them and find who needs your help and why. Sales teams know who'd thank them for a cold email/call now, and can sound relevant without hrs of manual research. \r\n\r\nTypically, targeted outreach yields 2-8x higher booking rate compared to random outreach.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example intent signals we track**:\r\n- Bookkeeping automation product: Monitor who starts to hire human to manually enter invoices\r\n- Compliance product: Monitor who recently onboarded a new Compliance Analyst\r\n- CRM integrations: Monitor who starts to hire engineers experienced in Salesforce API.",
