Every game needs to be translated - a process which currently consists of finding freelancers, verifying their quality, negotiating prices, building contracts and waiting months for them to deliver. \r\n\r\nWith MagnaPlay, game developers cut out the middleman and get results 5x faster, at half the price and with more reliable quality. Our combination of AI, expert translators and SAAS fully integrates translation into the gamedev workflow, ensuring games are translated and reach the worldwide audiences that love them so much.",
