  "long_description": "Blyss is an AI model provider built on strong security guarantees. We run AI workloads in GPU-based secure enclaves, which keep data encrypted even while it's being processed. Our customers get a privacy model similar to on-premises deployment, without ever having to think about AI infrastructure or GPU supply.  \r\n\r\nThe Blyss team has strong experience in cryptography and AI from Stanford, Apple, Nvidia, and more. We think data privacy is fundamental to safe, trustworthy AI, so it's our job to make end-to-end encrypted AI a no-compromise option - just like Signal and WhatsApp did for messaging.",
