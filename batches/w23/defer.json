  "long_description": "Defer enables Node.js developers to move slow code out of the user's journey.\r\nIts simple and well-documented API enables developers to improve web applications' performance in a few minutes instead of days.\r\n\r\nBryan and Charly noticed that all companies end up building similar abstractions and dashboards over the existing open-source (BullMQ) or commercial solutions (AWS SQS + Lambdas) to support background jobs, CRONs, and workflows.\r\n\r\nDefer brings a full-featured and managed platform with a Vercel-like developer experience that comes with an operational dashboard, enabling developers to focus on product work.\r\n\r\nAfter building the self-serve version of Defer in 8 weeks and onboarding 5 paying customers, their recent HN launch brought 250+ users and a warm welcome from the Node.js community with the 2 biggest newsletters featuring Defer and tech influencers spreading the word.\r\n\r\nDefer is now available as a Node.js solution but aims to become a cross-language reference.",
