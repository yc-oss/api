  "long_description": "Modern teams work in the browser. But browsers weren't built for teams 😔. \r\n\r\nThis leads to a bunch of problems like:\r\n- Knowledge/info that is hard to find (links that get lost, documentation that gets, buried, silos, etc)\r\n- Poor collaboration\r\n- Inefficient workflows\r\n\r\nLinkGrep is an AI browser copilot that solves those problems by making your browser team friendly.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we help teams:\r\n1. 🔗 Keep track of links, documents, and more automatically. With LinkGrep you'll never have to manually add or save a link.\r\n2. 🔍 Find information that matters. LinkGrep connects with your existing tools like Notion and Slack and will automatically suggest relevant information to you as your browse (we have semantic search that you can fallback on). Demo: https://youtu.be/jwcPGDRy4oQ\r\n3. 👥 Collaborate better. LinkGrep lets you leave notes and comments directly on web pages — you won't ever have to copy paste a link into Slack ever again. \r\n4. 🤖 Automate team actions like opening up the right links before a meeting. Never disrupt a meeting to send a link again. Demo: https://youtu.be/an3VKpAWft0",
