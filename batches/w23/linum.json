At Linum, we’re using AI to build the tools that will enable this transition.\r\n\r\nLinum was founded by Sahil Chopra and Manu Chopra - two brothers with 10 years of AI experience. Sahil co-wrote Stanford’s graduate-course on LLMs (Large Language Models). Manu trained RL (Reinforcement Learning) models for anesthesia administration at UCSF. \r\n\r\nSign up for our beta at https://www.linum.ai/",
