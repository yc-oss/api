  "long_description": "90% of security breaches are caused by a simple employee mistake. \r\n\r\nYour employee gets a bad link, clicks an email, then types in their password, and maybe even their two-factor code - because it looks just like the normal company login page!\r\n\r\nAttackers have proven that your MFA is not enough. 0pass allows you to completely circumvent these basic risks by switching to a passwordless login that can't be stolen.\r\n\r\nFounded by cybersecurity leaders from SpaceX, AWS, and Blue Origin - we're building security tools that solve the biggest problems, without headaches for your employees.",
