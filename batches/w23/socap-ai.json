  "long_description": "At Socap.ai, we help founders and investors to grow their network and fundraise better with AI.\r\n\r\nAs experienced founders and investors (Slava is an ex-VC with 2 unicorns from seed portfolio and a top YC founder who has raised $180M over his entrepreneurial career; Alex is a repeat AI founder with an exit and has helped dozens of founders to raise early-stage funding), we're constantly bombarded with emails/DMs from fellow founders asking for fundraising help and intros.\r\n\r\nWe get it â€” fundraising is tough, especially in the current environment. There's so much advice that you don't even know who to listen to. With Socap.ai, we make it at least 2 times easier by giving founders a proven YC-style \"parallel fundraising\" playbook (remember â€” we ourselves have raised over $200M using it), an accountable community, and exclusive access to the Socap.ai platform where you can easily manage and grow your founder/investor network for your fundraising needs and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe're currently in beta and onboarding users through various community initiatives (ours or our VC/accelerator partners). Learn more and apply to one of our free fundraising bootcamps here: Socap.ai",
