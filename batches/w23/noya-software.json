  "long_description": "Noya is a new kind of product design tool for non-designers. This is our second time co-founding a design tools company â€“ our first company was acquired by Airbnb in 2017 and we became the design tools team there.\r\n\r\nAt Airbnb, we built the design infrastructure that the entire company relied on to scale design without increasing headcount costs. We did this by letting non-designers (such as marketing, PMs, and engineering) design screens and websites.  Now we're making these tools available to every company.",
