  "long_description": "AlphaWatch AI is an agentic search platform designed for finance and industrial firms. By using custom LLMs, specialized embedding models, and integrating with both trusted external data sources and secure private data, AlphaWatch AI offers a reliable chat interface that cites its sources, saving financial professionals time on research. \r\n\r\nWe aim to solve a very real pain point: data is currently disjointed, and knowledge workers lose several hours a day finding and searching for answers in their data. While LLMs should solve this research problem, their results are prone to hallucinations and don't include internal information.\r\n\r\nWith efficient data integration and valuable insights, AlphaWatch AI is enhancing the way financial institutions and industrial firms access essential information and make informed decisions while maintaining data privacy",
