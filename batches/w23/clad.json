  "long_description": "Clad is construction management software for telecom companies.\r\n\r\nWe help telcos like Comcast or Sonic find, manage, and pay their construction subcontractors when doing things like laying fiber or building a cell tower.\r\n\r\nTelco construction is a massive, $86B per year industry that still runs on spreadsheets and phone calls. Clad's wedge product will modernize contractor management, but we're not stopping there. We'll build a data moat that will power the industryâ€™s spend, an over $3B opportunity.\r\n\r\nClad's ultimate goal - expand beyond internet to power all infrastructure construction, so the backbone of our world gets built faster.",
