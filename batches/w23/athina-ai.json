  "long_description": "Athina is an end-to-end platform for product teams building production-grade AI features.\r\n\r\n1. Prototype: Dynamic Columns let you run LLM prompts, execute code, make API calls, retrieve data, run transformations, and more (in a spreadsheet UI)\r\n\r\n2. Evaluate: Run evaluations within the sheet itself - there are 50+ preset evaluation metrics or you can create your own custom evals (no-code).\r\n\r\n3. Experiment: Change your prompt, model, retriever, or chain in just a few clicks. Technical users can run even more experiments programmatically.\r\n\r\n4. Compare:  Compare any number of datasets side-by-side with a diff view, and run evaluations on all of them simultaneously\r\n\r\n5. Observability: Monitor your LLM features in production with continuous evaluations and granular analytics.\r\n\r\nAthina can be used by non-technical users as well as technical users. This means PMs, QA, Data Scientists, and Engineers can collaborate to build great AI products.\r\n",
