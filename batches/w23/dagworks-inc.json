  "long_description": "Weâ€™re on a mission to enable everyone to build reliable AI agents & AI applications. We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",
