  "long_description": "Fabius helps sales leaders understand and improve their reps' performance by analyzing customer calls with AI. Companies like Airbyte and Fermat use us to score every call and identify when a customer hasnâ€™t been properly qualified.\r\n\r\nFabius helps drive decisions within sales, including:\r\n- Disqualify a deal: Reps work on deals that will never close. We identify the deals that won't be successful and make sure reps don't waste time on them.\r\n- Need to strengthen the business case for a deal: We tell managers and reps when a deal has a weak business case and show them how to uncover more business value in the deal.",
