  "long_description": "Small shop owners earn daily unlike salaried people but when it comes to loan repayment both are asked to pay monthly. For these shop owners it is difficult to calculate how much to save daily so that they will have the required installment amount at the end of the month and also at the time of repayment they have a big hole in their working capital.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when you earn daily why not pay daily and get away from the stress of huge one-time installments. \r\n\r\nEvery day a small amount of $X is deducted from your digital wallet which is on the auto-debit mandate and you don't need to worry about keeping your balance of $XXXX. You never default and also good credit scores are created.",
