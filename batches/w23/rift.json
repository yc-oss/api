  "long_description": "rift is a sales platform that helps salespeople focus on what they do best – selling.\r\n\r\nOn rift, you can accomplish everything you have to do to close deals - send emails, run sequences, cold call, and book meetings.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that rift automates everything in between. If your data is a bit messy - we’ll clean it for you. If it takes a long time to figure out who to reach out to - our platform will flag the most likely leads to engage. If your emails are landing in spam - rift will set up the infrastructure to make sure that you're not landing in spam because of incorrect setup.\r\n\r\nSales teams today spend 70% of their time not selling. rift’s mission is to give that time back to them so they can focus on selling again.\r\n",
