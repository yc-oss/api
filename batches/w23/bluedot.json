  "long_description": "Bluedot makes EV charging payment easier and simplifies expense management for drivers and fleets. They're growing 40-45% weekly and made $110K GMV last week.\r\n\r\nOver 50% of vehicles sold will be electric by 2030. The payments management infrastructure for EV charging and the expenses doesnâ€™t exist at the moment. The founders operated 100+ EV charging stations, worked in companies like Zipcar, Bosch, and Mercedes, and faced this problem through their own experiences. They built a team with a strong fintech background and publicly launched their Bluedot card on Dec 14th, 2022.\r\n\r\nBluedot has raised their pre-seed from Y Combinator, Axel Springer, Porsche, Ford, TechNexus, DRF, and Pritchard Automotive.
