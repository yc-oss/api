  "long_description": "Radical makes high-altitude solar-powered aircraft. Our aircraft fly at 70,000 feet, autonomously navigating in the stratosphere. They can be used to provide cell service, collect multi-spectral imagery, or to carry weather and climate sensors. Our aircraft offer an inexpensive, zero-emissions way to connect and observe earth like never before. Prior to Radical, our founders worked together for 6 years developing Amazonâ€™s delivery drones.",
