  "long_description": "Reflex is the open-source framework empowering Python developers to build web apps faster. Build both your frontend and backend in a single language, Python (pip install reflex), with no JavaScript or web development experience required.\r\n\r\nBuild anything from internal data and AI apps to large public-facing web apps and deploy with a single command (reflex deploy).\r\n\r\nReflex provides high-level UI components, easy deployment and AI agents to create, edit, and deploy apps 10x faster than traditional web development while also remaining extensible through custom components that can fully leverage JavaScript's expressivity.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to simplify web development by creating an ecosystem of open-source tools and hosted services that enable Python developers to build web apps faster without compromising on customizability, flexibility, or performance.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex",
