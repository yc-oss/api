  "long_description": "Cell and gene therapy promises to one day cure any disease; Modulari-Tâ€™s Platform produces the tools to fulfill that promise.\r\n\r\nModulari-T has designed a new family of synthetic genes that can reprogram cells to better sense their environment and modify their behavior accordingly. This can be used to engineer immune cells to efficiently recognize and kill cancer cells or to create stem cells able to regenerate any tissue.\r\n\r\nModulari-T looks to expand its technology to reach every area of cell therapy and become the platform of reference for cell engineering.",
