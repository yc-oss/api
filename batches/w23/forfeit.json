Send photo or timelapse evidence of you completing the habit by the time you set, or we take your money.\r\n\r\nEg, I could set it to go to the gym (or meditate for 30 mins, or take a photo of a sent email, or of a max amount of calories on MyFitnessPal) tomorrow at 6am, or lose $30. If I don't send photo evidence in the gym (that we manually approve), I lose $30.",
