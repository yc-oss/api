  "long_description": "Storyboarder is a tool and a platform for anyone to create, share, and sell webcomics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn East Asia, the webcomic (or digital manga) industry is an $12B market and rapidly growing to the rest of the world. Webtoon, the largest company in the space, generates $100M / month in revenue. However, their addressable market is limited by their content creators, who need know how to draw. Readers are desperate for a greater variety of stories in webcomics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough years of working with filmmakers, we’ve built extremely easy to use storyboarding software  that has 700K users. We’re democratizing visual storytelling to everyone. We’re working on the next generation that, through advances in video game interfaces, ubiquitous 3D compute, and AI, will allow anyone to easily create scenes, pose characters, to create webcomics. \r\n\r\n\r\nStoryboarder is backed by Y Combinator (W23), David Karp (Tumblr Founder), Andrew Kortina (Venmo Founder), and other product focused investors.",
