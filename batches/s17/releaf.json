  "long_description": "Releaf develops novel industrial processing technology for African crops. Our pre-processing technology allows us to improve the quality and scale of raw materials provided to African food factories (>$200B market), 90% of which run under 50% of their installed capacity, primarily due to scarce quality raw materials.\r\n\r\nWe target domestic demand in industries where we can develop pre-processing technology to increase the amount of addressable, quality raw material we can source directly from farmers, giving us a leg-up on competitors who rely on inconsistent traders with variable quality.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to catalyze agro-based industrialization across the continent - no phenomena in the history of the world has moved more people out of extreme poverty and into shared prosperity than industrialization.",
