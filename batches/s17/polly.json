The app allows users to create multiple-choice polls for sharing on Snapchat and other platforms. \r\n\r\nPolly launched in stealth in August and it quickly became popular among teens, with 20 million people voting over 100 million times across 5 million polls in the past month. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being a casual social tool, Polly can also be used to gather opinions about popular brands. For instance, Polly received thousands of responses from teens on some of its own polls related to topics such as breakfast cereals and Starbucks drinks. Brands and influencers can also create their own polls to gather feedback from consumers.",
