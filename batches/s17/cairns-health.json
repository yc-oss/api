  "long_description": "Cairns Health is creating a fundamentally better healthcare experience for people with chronic health conditions and those who care for them. We make healthcare more accessible by simplifying complex care plans, connecting care teams and meeting patients where they live. Through our conversational AI, patients use their voice to interact with our digital care companion, who proactively gives medication reminders, symptom checks, behavioral nudges and even engages in friendly conversation to ease loneliness. Cairns uses a device that includes radar to put the patient in context and passively monitors their activities, including: heart rate, breathing rate and sleep stages, all without a wearable. The result is informed and timely intervention that drives improved clinical outcomes, reduced care delivery costs and a more satisfactory healthcare experience for all.",
