  "long_description": "PreDxion Bio is working on a rapid saliva-based antigen test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients. Our technology is uniquely capable of being scaled to 10's of millions of tests of days using semiconductor fab processes, a scale of testing necessary to better inform public health officials and policymakers and enable contact tracing at scale.\r\n\r\nPreDxion Bio's origins are in critical care: our original technology is a rapid, near real-time cytokine and biomarker detection platform to monitor the immune response of critically-ill patients. This technology leverages a novel sensor platform we spun out of the University of Michigan. PreDxion Bio has received FDA Breakthrough Device designation and partnered with top pharmcos to monitor the immune response following CAR-T therapy and predict the development of cytokine release syndrome and neurological AEs, and for use in guiding precision medicine approaches in critical care.",
