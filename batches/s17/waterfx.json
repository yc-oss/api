  "long_description": "At Wacomet Water (formerly WATERFX) we are reimagining water. Our current water system was designed for a global population of three billion people and by the end of this century we will need clean water for over ten billion people. Our mission is to use technology to develop a new source of fresh water and make access to water affordable and abundant for every human being on the planet. We do this using solar-powered desalination to generate water from an infinite source of salt water and distribute this water via a peer-to-peer distribution platform called Liquid. Our mission is to provide a better, more reliable, 100% sustainable water service to consumers, businesses and cities.",
