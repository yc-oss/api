By giving people smarter options, Feather is able to keep more furniture in homes and out of landfills.\r\n\r\nMonthly furniture payments can go toward ownership or you can simply return the furniture you no longer need. Those items endure our extensive refurbishment process before they are sent to live in their next home. Our reverse logistics platform allows our customers to swap and add new furniture at any time, helping limit furniture waste.",
