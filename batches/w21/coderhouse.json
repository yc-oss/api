  "long_description": "A web app that offers live online courses in programming, design, data, online marketing and more.\r\n\r\nOur courses are nearly as affordable as online Moocs (~$40 a month) and as effective as Bootcamps. We achieve this by running 100 person live classes with one expert professor and one mentor per 15 students. Every class, students need to turn in assignments that are corrected by their mentors and at the end of the course they need to turn in and approve a final project. We also help our selected students with careers services such as mockup interviews, Linkedin enhancement, and more. All of this creates a level of accountability that allows us to achieve really low churn levels (<9%).\r\n\r\nOur career tracks last between 9-11 months and we give our selected students their money back in case they don't get a job 6 months after they are done with the course.",
