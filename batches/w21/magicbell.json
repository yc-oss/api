  "long_description": "MagicBell is the notification inbox for web & mobile apps.\r\n\r\nAs consumers of many apps, we have personally experienced the growing volume of notifications - many of which add to our anxiety instead of helping us manage it. MagicBell is on a mission to end this chaos and help every app deliver a stellar notification experience.\r\n\r\nWe do this by offering a beautifully designed notification inbox that apps can embed in their products in minutes. We do all the heavy lifting related to real-time delivery & syncing, web & mobile push notifications, email notifications, and even notification preference management.\r\n\r\nWe sit at an interesting intersection of a dev tool & a productivity tool for end-users. We are helping every app make its users more productive!",
