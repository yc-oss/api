  "long_description": "Bimaplan is an affordable insurance platform for the next billion Indians.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to provide financial security to 150 million vulnerable households through contextual life and health insurance products. The growth in mobile penetration and the evolution of digital infrastructure in India has now made it possible to reach this vulnerable population. This is an $8 billion addressable market.\r\n\r\nWe launched in February 2021, and went live with one insurance underwriting partner. We are on track to sell 1,000 policies in March 2021. We are backed by some of the best early stage technology investors, successful fintech founders, and insurance industry veterans.\r\n\r\nThe company is founded by Vikul Goyal, a second-time founder with a successful exit track record. His previous venture, Carcrew, was acquired by TVS Group, a large automotive conglomerate in India.",
