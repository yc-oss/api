  "long_description": "Intro to Orbillion Bio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAf21WXxnhw (Slush Nov 2024)\r\n\r\nOrbillion is making cultivated beef at scale using advanced computational models to rapidly optimize the bioprocess and reduce cost. With Orbillion’s proprietary bioware, they can precisely control the microenvironment that the meat cells need. This supercharges cell growth without the need for GMO, serum, or expensive growth factors, enabling a cost of $4 per kg at commercial scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrbillion’s technology addresses the industry's two main challenges: cost and scale-up. Its integrated bioprocess platform allows Orbillion to  produce at a commercial level  anywhere globally within two weeks in an asset-light fashion. Partnerships with two global food companies of combined $280B revenue, and a European partner have fast-tracked commercialization in the $211B ground beef market. Founders Dr. Patricia Bubner and Samet Yildirim are the only industry founders with scale-up experience in mammalian cells from the biopharma industry. Orbillion is backed by The Venture Collective, Y Combinator, At One Ventures, Venture Souq, and Hub71 among others.",
