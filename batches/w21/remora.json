  "long_description": "We're building carbon capture for trains and trucks. We generate revenue for railroads and trucking companies by extracting, purifying, and selling CO2 from their exhaust. Our technology can capture up to 90% of the CO2 in the vehicle's exhaust while reducing soot, particulate matter, and NOx.\r\n\r\nWe've partnered with Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, Ryder, and Werner, and raised $117 million from Lowercarbon Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Union Square Ventures, and Y Combinator.",
