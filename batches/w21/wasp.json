  "long_description": "Wasp is a simple configuration language for building enterprise web apps with less code and best practices. If a developer wants to build an app like Instacart, they need to know a dozen different technologies and how to make them work together - Wasp solves this problem while still letting developers use React, Node.js and their other favourite tools.\r\n\r\nWe will enable enterprises to build modern apps quickly at scale, like Databricks did for data management.",
