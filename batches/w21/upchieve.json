  "long_description": "UPchieve is an edtech nonprofit that provides free, 24/7 online tutoring to low-income HS students. Using our app, students can request and get paired with a live volunteer in under 5 minutes. We’ve matched 100,000+ requests so far.\r\n\r\nRight now in the US, there are 8 million low-income HS students who don’t have anyone in their home who can help them with schoolwork. UPchieve is working to change that. Our vision is simple: we want to democratize access to academic support, so that every student has an equal opportunity to attend college and achieve upward mobility.",
