  "long_description": "Up to 90% of skin aging is caused by the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light. Daily sunscreen use provides crucial protection against this damage, yet most people only apply it during periods of high sun exposure. There are two reasons for this. First, most people don’t know that most skin aging is caused by cumulative sun exposure, even on cloudy days. And second, sunscreens have an unpleasant, greasy texture. \r\n\r\nAt Lygg, we’re transforming sun protection. Our new ingredients triple the anti-aging protection of sunscreens and eliminate their greasy feel. Our mission is to make wearing sunscreen a part of everyone’s daily routine.\r\n",
