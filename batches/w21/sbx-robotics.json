  "long_description": "SBX Robotics generates synthetic data that teaches robots to see. We use simulation software to create training data 10x faster and cheaper than annotation services or in-house teams. \r\n\r\nInstead of being blocked on data, our clients send 25 images from their robotâ€™s camera, and receive 25,000 perfectly labeled synthetic training images. SBX data is ready to be used by deep learning computer vision models. ",
