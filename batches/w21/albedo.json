  "long_description": "Albedo is the first space company to commercialize the new orbit regime of VLEO (very low earth orbit). VLEO enables enhanced data quality for numerous earth observation modalities.\r\n \r\nOur first VLEO satellite, named Clarity and built in-house, is launching in 2025 and will capture visible & thermal images at a resolution that can only be obtained today from drones/planes (commercially) or classified National Security systems.\r\n\r\nThe world is rapidly changing and a new level of visibility and transparency is required to solve some of our largest problems. Albedoâ€™s 10cm visible and 2m thermal imagery will fuel insights for industries such as mapping, insurance, utilities, solar, agriculture, carbon offsets, infrastructure sustainability, national security, and much more.",
