  "long_description": "In a nutshell: many diseases are caused by how much your cells squeeze (asthma, fibrosis, others). We discover drugs that control how much cells squeeze, with ease, to treat disease.\r\n\r\nWe use patented bioMEMS technology to turn cell strength (cells' ability to pull/ squeeze) into a quantifiable metric in drug discovery, to help find better drugs for mechanical diseases. \r\n\r\nWe screen 100,000s of drugs against numerous contractile human cell types to comprehensively map human mechanobiology (the \"contractome\") and identify promising drug development starting points to deliver novel medicines to treat mechanically-driven diseases including asthma, hypertension, preterm labor, fibrosis, and others.\r\n\r\n",
