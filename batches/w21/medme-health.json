  "long_description": "MedMe Health builds software for pharmacists to deliver paid clinical services like prescribing/adapting medications, point-of-care testing, giving vaccinations, and monitoring chronic conditions.  \r\n\r\nOur web-based platform helps both independent pharmacies and large chains schedule appointments online, conduct virtual care, automate documentation, and flag clinical opportunities. With MedMe, our customers have increased their efficiency of clinical service delivery by 10x and increased pharmacy revenue with the same staff.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, MedMe enables integrations to traditionally locally-stored pharmacy data. Our vision is to transform today’s dispensing locations to tomorrow’s health hubs. ",
