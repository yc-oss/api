  "long_description": "REGENT is building a new mode of transportation that will redefine regional mobility by 2026. Their first product, the seaglider, is an all-electric, hydrofoiling flying-boat that operates within a wingspan of the water's surface.  By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.\r\n \r\nREGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale flying demonstration vehicle. By this summer, REGENT will fly humans on the 15,000 lb (7000kg) first full-scale prototype seaglider, which will be the largest electric-flying machine in history.\r\n\r\nBy late 2026, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.  A 100 passenger version, already with firm orders, will follow several years later.\r\n\r\nIn just four years, REGENT has accumulated >$10B in pre-orders (including firm deposits) from airlines and ferry companies around the world.  Currently a team of 100, REGENT is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised over $100M to date from the likes of Founders Fund, Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Lockheed Martin, and is on contract with the US Marine Corps.",
