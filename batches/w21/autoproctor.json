  "long_description": "AutoProctor is an automated tool that ensures students donâ€™t cheat on online tests. As students take the test, AutoProctor monitors their camera, mic and the screen they are looking at. So, for example, if they try Googling an answer, this will be detected.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the test, depending on the type and frequency of these violations, AutoProctor calculates a Trust Score. Teachers can view the evidence gathered for those Test Attempts with a low Trust Score.",
