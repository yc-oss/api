  "long_description": "NextPay is a digital bank for small businesses and entrepreneurs in The Philippines. They use us to send invoices, collect payments, do payroll, and pay their bills.\r\n\r\nNextPay is the best alternative to bank accounts for small businesses and entrepreneurs in the Philippines. We help them similarly to how Brex helps companies in the US, but in a way that is more locally nuanced. We manage their finances and remove the steep barriers that Filipino banks and financial institutions typically require; no setup fees, maintaining balances, or ridiculous requirements. \r\n\r\nView the full context on our Launch Bookface post: \r\nhttps://bookface.ycombinator.com/posts/51999",
