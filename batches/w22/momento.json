  "long_description": "In Momento we are going through a challenging regulatory process to become a fully-licensed insurance carrier. By doing so, we will be able to underwrite risk, set prices and, ultimately, become owners of the product.\r\n\r\nOnce approved, around summer 22, we will be in a great position to size the $13bn untapped opportunity of +30 Mn uninsured vehicles â€“ just in Mexico! As we will be able to attack the main pain points in the market: i) antiquated underwriting models and ii) payment conditions only adapted for the affluent.\r\n\r\nTo succeed, we have assembled an elite team with both innovative and experienced profiles. We are three cofounders, two ex-McKinsey and one ex-P&G, and we managed to attract two heavyweights of the Mexican insurance industry: the previous CUO of Zurich Mexico and the previous CFO and VP of Finance of ING and AXA Mexico.
