Our goal is to save sellers time and help them make more money. The user friendly interface allows sellers to crosspost their items onto multiple marketplaces in a fraction of the time that it takes to do so manually. Users can currently list items onto 10 marketplaces, including eBay, Poshmark, Etsy, Mercari, Facebook Marketplace and more.\r\n\r\nThe software also provides other conveniences for sellers, like the ability to easily import their existing listings, delisting and relisting items with one click, and inventory management features like easy sorting and searching.
