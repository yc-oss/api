The collective responsibility of the group serves as a collateral on the loan while the social pressure from the members ensures on-time repayment. There are over 44million SMBs in Africa. \r\n \r\nWe launched 7 months ago and we already have $72k MRR growing at 50% MoM. We achieved 99% repayment on 11,000 units of loans with over $5M disbursed. This is 15 times higher than most financial services in Africa.\r\n \r\nFemi (CEO) worked previously with the World Bank with a focus on financial services while Dapo (CTO) led the development of the technology for one of the largest digital lending apps\r\n\r\nWe are also backed by Y Combinator(W22), Magic Fund, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital and more.\r\n",
