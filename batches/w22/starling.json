  "long_description": "Starling is building a urine diagnostic remote patient monitoring platform that seamlessly integrates into anyone's bathroom routine.  By detecting early changes in a patient's urine using our toilet indwelling mass spectroscopy device, our platform is aiming to prevent hospitalizations from numerous conditions like recurrent UTIs, BPH exacerbations, or diabetes. We do this while creating significant new annual revenues for our clinician partners from remote patient monitoring reimbursements without requiring any significant changes in a staff's day to day schedule.
