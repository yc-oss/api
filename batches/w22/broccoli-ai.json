  "long_description": "Broccoli AI is building AI voice agents for home service businesses. We help plumbing, HVAC, and electrical contractors answer every call, book more jobs, and run more efficient operations — fully integrated with CRMs like ServiceTitan. We launched 10 months ago and built the solution inside a plumber’s office in Sacramento. Customers are seeing 2–3x higher booking rates and dramatically faster response times compared to traditional answering services. We're already working with industry leaders like the Any Hour Group — and growing over 30% month over month. We're based in San Francisco and backed by Y Combinator.\r\nwww.broccoli.com\r\n",
