  "long_description": "At Alfie, we've built a rigorous virtual medical program based on the top research from Cleveland Clinic and Harvard that allows us to precisely determine which weight loss regimen and (as needed) medications will be most effective for our members in a multimodal approach. We're optimizing exercise/nutrition/medications in complex care pathways like no one else has before.\r\n\r\nOur program has been shown to be 2x more effective than standard prescription medication and 5x more effective than habit change alone.\r\n\r\nWe've raised capital from Goodwater Capital, Nina Capital, Air Force Ventures, and Phoenix Club, and various super angels including the founder of OpenTrons (medical labs automation; have raised $240 mill). Also, we're a Y Combinator graduate.",
