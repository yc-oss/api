  "long_description": "91Squarefeet is solving the coordination problem in interior projects. These projects require high-frequency coordination over a small time window, and we have found a neat solution. \r\n\r\nOur tech, Rdash.io, onboarded 150 organizations in its first 12 months. ICICI Bank, Shopper Stop, and Simpliwork use it for project tracking, subcontracting, and procurement. Monthly, $15Mn projects are created and $5Mn procurement happens on Rdash. Companies that are using Rdash typically save 10% in their fit-out expenditure. \r\n\r\nOn the back of this tech, we have scaled our business of building offices and retail shops to $10Mn Annualised Revenue. We have built 1100+ offices and retail shops for MongoDB, HSBC, Calvin Klein, and 60 other customers. \r\n",
