  "long_description": "At voize, we’re revolutionizing the healthcare industry with AI: Nurses simply speak their documentation into their smartphones, and our AI automatically generates the correct entries. This saves each nurse an average of 39 minutes per day, improves the quality of documentation, and makes their daily work much more rewarding.\r\n\r\nvoize is YCombinator-funded, already in use at over 600 senior care homes, and has grown by 100% in the last 90 days. Our customers save over 3.5 million hours annually – time spent on people instead of paperwork.\r\n\r\nBut this is just the beginning. With our self-developed voize AI, we’re transforming not only the healthcare industry, but also have the potential to create value in many other sectors – from healthcare to inspections.",
