  "long_description": "Suggestr is a self-serve, no-code personalization solution for the 20M+ e-commerce brands that sell on platforms like Shopify. Marketplaces like Amazon drive up to 30% of their sales from personalized surfaces (recommendations, bundles, frequently bought together, et cetera). They have large data science teams that build such in-house recommendation engines. However, DTC brands can't afford to do this, and they don't have enough customer data to make the conventional recommendation approaches work. Suggestr uses innovative multi-modal AI technology that sees and understands products (needs 100x less data), allowing it to work with brands of all sizes (SME, mid-market, enterprise). The solution takes less than 30 minutes to integrate and helps merchants increase online store revenues by up to 10% with AI-driven upsells and cross-sells.",
