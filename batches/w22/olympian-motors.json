  "long_description": "Olympian Motors is an electric vehicle company, based in New York. \r\n\r\nWe are manufacturing electric vehicles with our innovative 'modular' vehicle & drivetrain architecture (MVDS), providing Olympian with strong cost and lead-time advantages compared to legacy automakers like Tesla and Ford.\r\n\r\nOlympian is disrupting 120+ years old automotive industry and targeting to capture 7% market share in the U.S. automotive market by 2030.\r\n\r\nWe changed the status-quo in automotive design, and bring aesthetic, color, experience and minimalism back to the cars.\r\n\r\nOlympian MVDS has a 'Lego-like' architecture and built on 4-core-hardware and 2-software modules. We achieved 80% reduction in tooling & machinery costs and built ~60% faster production lead time.\r\n\r\nWe aim to reinvent the car manufacturing and bringing agility, speed and cost-efficiency back to the U.S. automotive industry.\r\n\r\n+ Received 214 pre-orders for Olympian Model O1  ($17M+ pre-booked revenue)\r\n+ Started manufacturing our EVs in Brooklyn & Detroit facilities. 2023 capacity: 320 vehicles\r\n+ Pending traffic approval from NHTSA\r\n+ Modular vehicle/drivetrain + Modular manufacturing: 4-hardware + 1-sofware modules. ~60% faster production lead time. 80% reduction in tooling, fitment and labor expenses. \r\n+ Commercial Launch in Q3/2023. Unlike other EV companies, we don't waste time/resources. (It took 9+ years for Lucid and 11+ years for Rivian to make their first shipment).\r\n+ Super-competitive battery efficiency in urban areas (Olympian early prototypes achieved slightly better miles/kwh efficiency than Tesla Model 3 and Rivian).\r\n+ Carbon-sequestered and recyclable materials for +4% of vehicle components.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlympian rejects today's commoditized and banal car experience.  \r\n+ We challenge the status-quo in automotive. \r\n+ We prioritize aesthetic, nature and minimalism.  \r\n+ We use steel and wood in Olympian cars rather than not cheap plastic and toxic chemicals. \r\n+ We have minimalistic cockpit, powered by Olympian Operating System (OOS)\r\n",
