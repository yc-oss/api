  "long_description": "Perl Street is democratizing structured finance through our platform, unlocking billions in financing for sustainable infrastructure and next-generation hardware technologies. \r\n\r\nPerl Street has already helped multiple hardware startups receive over $140M in debt financing offers from some of the world’s most reputable institutions.\r\n\r\nClimate change is a massive hardware problem. According to IEA estimates - reaching net zero emissions would require over $4 trillion per year in global clean energy investment. \r\n\r\nThis means we need to upgrade nearly everything with new hardware - from energy storage devices to electric vehicles, charging stations and building electrification. \r\n\r\nThe future of infrastructure is both distributed and resilient. And none of it is possible without financing new hardware.",
