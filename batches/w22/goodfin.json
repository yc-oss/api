  "long_description": "GoodFin is reimagining private wealth in the era of AI. Our mission is to empower a new generation to build wealth, starting with their investments in alternative assets. \r\n\r\nOur AI-native platform combines a design-forward experience with a backend powered by a system of intelligent agents. We are building a future where AI unlocks financial hyperpersonalization, automation and optimization for sophisticated financial products, which are typically gated by advisors and reserved for very wealthy clients. This highly fragmented $1.25T global services market will undergo a sea change in the coming years, as trillions pass in the largest intergenerational wealth transfer to date.  \r\n\r\nIn a world where most financial decisions will become automated, we believe the next category-defining wealth company will still be human-driven at its core – powered by a high-value community like our membership base of professionals, founders and investors. The next generation financial giant will be an AI-native platform that makes wealth creation seamless, personalized, and social. That’s what we’re building.",
