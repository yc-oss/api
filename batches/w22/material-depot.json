  "long_description": "The problem - Material discovery today is a big pain for the design community\r\n\r\nCountless hours are spent browsing to catalogues, visiting offline stores, coordinating with vendors for samples, getting quotations and finalizing materials. All of this process removes focus and causes hindrance to the process of design\r\n\r\nThe Solution - Discovery engine and AI design tools to make the process easy and seamless\r\n\r\nWe are building a digital library of materials across different categories with seamless search functionalities. On top that we are enabling the community with a image recognition tool and a digital mood board to embed the right material in the design",
