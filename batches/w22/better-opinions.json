  "long_description": "Better Opinions is a prediction market of India which allows users to trade their opinion on everyday topics. For example, If you think India Covid cases will decrease by 10% this week, you can trade this insight and win money if correct.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to make the app inclusive for all. The stock market unfortunately can be very technical and opaque and therefore isnâ€™t always accessible for all. However, when we start allowing trading in categories such as cricket, politics and entertainment, not only do we make trading more relatable, but we also help improve their financial literacy.",
