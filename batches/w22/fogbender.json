  "long_description": "Fogbender helps B2B companies support customer teams: think Intercom meets Slack's shared channels.\r\n\r\nToday, all customer software is explicitly or implicitly designed for helping individuals, not teams. This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, \"unofficial\", system: Slack's shared channels.\r\n\r\nThis causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.\r\n\r\nWith Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions.",
