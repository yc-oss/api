They can simply use our Plugins or Copy-Paste style APIs and go live in under 5 minutes without worrying about how Credit Risk or Capital/Compliances etc will work. Simply connect with the BharatX platform and start disbursing Credit. \r\n\r\nBe it to enable a White-Labelled Pay Later option on Checkout or to give your Neobank's users a White-Labelled Instant Credit-Line option.  You can enable it all, as fast as 5 mins!\r\n\r\nSo next time you buy a course on Frontrow use \"Frontrow Pay in 3\" and while shopping offline, @Spenny's (YC) \"Credit\" feature to pay to Merchants Offline on UPI.
