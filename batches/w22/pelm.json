  "long_description": "Pelm is building an API that allows companies to access their user's energy data from utilities. Using Pelm, you can query hourly electricity usage or transfer service for a specific property. Instead of building clunky integrations with hundreds of utilities across the U.S., you only need to integrate with one seamless API to start harnessing energy data. Our platform will provide the infrastructure for a whole new wave of climate focused technology companies to flourish. As sustainability-oriented efforts like automated demand response, home electrification, or solar installations (to name a few) become more popular, they will need certain tools to succeed. We at Pelm hope our universal API will help our world reduce carbon emissions, meet climate goals, and create a more sustainable life for everyone.",
