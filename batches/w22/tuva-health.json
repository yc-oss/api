  "long_description": "At Tuva Health, we make open source software that cleans and transforms messy healthcare data.  Weâ€™re founded by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga, former senior execs from Health Catalyst and Strive Health.  We realized data transformation and data quality is the fundamental problem preventing the healthcare industry from building scalable data products.  We launched Tuva and joined the W22 batch of Y Combinator to solve this problem for the entire industry.  Since January 1st, we signed our first customer (paying $10k per month) and completed the first major release of the Tuva Project.  At Tuva, our goal is to (1) become the open standard for healthcare data transformation and (2) build the data network for multi-site benchmarking, research, and machine learning on top of this open standard.",
