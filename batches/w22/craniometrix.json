  "long_description": "Alzheimer’s is tough. And while there is no cure, getting help should be 100x easier than it is today. We’ve raised over $6 million to solve that problem. \r\n\r\nWhen someone is going through the disease, there are many different things they need help with (i.e. memory issues, depression, fall risk, safety in the home, etc). The primary person responsible for that care is one of the patient’s loved ones – usually a child or a spouse.\r\n\r\nThat’s a really difficult thing for the loved one to do. It’s stressful, time consuming, and difficult. If we can make their lives easier, we can not only improve their experience but also create better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the world’s first one-stop-shop, d2c care platform for Alzheimer’s, starting by optimizing the care monitoring, management, and intervention processes.",
