  "long_description": "Digital health holds a lot of potential but is ignoring a growing problem: diagnostic testing. Without this data, providers and organizations will be limited in the services they can provide patients at home.\r\n\r\nScout has developed a platform - Hub, test kits, and app - that delivers health testing at home with 10x lower development cost and 3x lower per-test price. Our patented tech also meets performance requirements for medical diagnoses and integrates with the current healthcare tech stack. Scoutâ€™s technology is poised to disrupt the outdated $33Bn diagnostic market by democratizing testing while dramatically improving the patient experience.\r\n\r\nScout has received $16M in non-dilutive funding from the NIH and other organizations to fully de-risk our platform, and our pipeline includes a diverse test menu for primary care (e.g. respiratory and sexual health), wellness (e.g. gut health), and chronic conditions (e.g. certain cancers). We have already received FDA authorization for our platform in clinical settings and are planning to launch our flagship Scout Hub in 2024.",
