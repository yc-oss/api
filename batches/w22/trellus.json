  "long_description": "Trellus delivers simple coaching prompts to your salespeople in real time as they speak to prospects. Prompts are delivered in response to what is happening in a conversation. The goal of these prompts is to get more reps achieving quota and to reduce the time it takes to start attaining quota.\r\n\r\nPrompts are action-oriented steps toward empathetic listening and effective discovery. Examples include 'pause' (when talking too much), 'set next steps' (when wrapping up a call without them), and 'ask current state' (when encountering objections).\r\n\r\nTrellus is backed by Y Combinator and founded by former MIT researchers.",
