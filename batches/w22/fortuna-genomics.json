  "long_description": "Fortuna Genomics employs methods from revolutionary genomics studies to non-invasively assess embryo traits, enabling parents to optimize their children's innate qualities without the need for gene editing. Through comprehensive genetic screening and forecasting, it empowers families to make informed decisions, optimizing their childâ€™s well-being and capabilities from conception.\r\n\r\nWith the convergence of advancements in genomic technologies, association studies, and sequencing efficiency, we are at a unique inflection point where such services can become widely accessible and impactful. Accurately predicting complex traits from genetic markers involves sophisticated models that must account for the interplay between countless biological and statistical factors. Our team is well-equipped to tackle this problem and make every parent's dream a reality by allowing them to give their children the best possible start in life.",
