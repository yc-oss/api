  "long_description": "Philippo is building the first proptech platform in Latam that provides liquidity to home equity.\r\n\r\nIn Latam, ~40% of homebuyers need to sell their current property in order to afford their new home. Buying and selling at the same time can be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nBy implementing a Sale and Leaseback transaction, Philippo enables homeowners to access their home equity before selling their property on the market, avoiding price discounts and eliminating the pain of moving twice and/or losing their dream home.",
