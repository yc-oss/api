  "long_description": "Adoption of Telehealth 1.0 has dropped to <5% because it's inefficient and unintelligent. Ankr uses generative AI to recreate functions of clinic staff including front desk, medical assistants and scribe. This allows Doctors to \"spin-up\" virtual clinics on-demand, anytime, anywhere. \r\n\r\nAn average clinic using Ankr generates $1M in new revenue/year.  We integrate with all top EHRs and work with all types of clinics in mid- to large-sized healthcare organizations.",
