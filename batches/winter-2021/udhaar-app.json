  "long_description": "We are a simple book-keeping app, to help 30M micro SMEs run their finances digitally.\r\n\r\nI was visiting Pakistan. 1-day, asked our local store owner on plans for his next location. His response, 'never'. \r\n\r\nSince business operations & money flow are manual, he worked 16 hours / 7 days to minimize theft. Zero time with family. We got obsessed with identifying how we can help small business owners run their business and have a life. \r\n\r\nEverything in Pakistan is manual, store credit, sales, purchasing inventory, cash management, tax filings, payments, etc.\r\n\r\nThis idea got us hooked as it allows us to build a large company and have a huge impact on ~30M small businesses in Pakistan that contribute 74% of the overall GDP.\r\n\r\nExplosion in 4G adoption (91M 4G subscribers, 720% growth in 5 years), is helping drive product market fit:\r\ni. >1M downloads\r\nii. 4.6 star rating on Playstore & Appstore\r\niii.
