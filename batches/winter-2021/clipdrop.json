  "long_description": "ClipDrop is an app that turns regular mobile photos into professional product visuals.\r\n\r\nThanks to companies like Poshmark, Etsy and Ebay, there are now over 25M sellers who need great visuals for their shops but most of them don’t have access to a professional photographer or a design team. We replace all of this with our app available on mobile and desktop.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of former Google, Facebook employees and Machine learning PhD’s and academic Professors. We believe that machine learning will bring professional photography and design to millions of businesses for a fraction of the cost.",
