  "long_description": "We are developing an implantable therapeutic tissue that will be surgically delivered to patients suffering from end stage renal disease.  Upon implantation, this tissue will supplement the patient's renal function, eliminating their dependency on dialysis and improving their disease status. This has the potential to not only get these patients off dialysis - a significant impact for them and their families - but to greatly extend the time required before kidney transplantation is essential.",
