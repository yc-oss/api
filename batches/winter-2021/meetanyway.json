  "long_description": "We help run engaging online conferences. Unlike Hopin or Zoom, we are super focused on connecting conference attendees with each other. Most attendees donâ€™t actually go to watch the talks, they go for the networking. With us they can self-organize, meet and stay in touch. Usually it's incredibly hard for the organizer to build conferences which lead to key business opportunities for the attendees. We have good networking built-in.",
