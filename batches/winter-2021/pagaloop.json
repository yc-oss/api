  "long_description": "Pagaloop helps business owners and persons in Latin America pay, get paid and extend cash flow using credit cards to finance expenses like rent, taxes, payroll and suppliers, via an extended network of relevant partnerships (federal/local governments, AMEX, HSBC, schools and universities, etc.). The Company provides a service in which a payment is made to a third party (that would typically not accept credit card as a payment method) in exchange for a fee of 4.7% (+ taxes). Additionally, Pagaloop offers payments in 3, 6, 9 or 12\r\nmonths with an extremely accessible commission. All of those solutions without taking any underwriting risk, which remains at the issuer of the credit line.",
