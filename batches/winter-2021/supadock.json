  "long_description": "Supadock builds AI workers for logistics operations. In freight, every call, document, and signature exists to prove diligence — not just save time. Check calls, proof-of-delivery reconciliations, ID verification, and invoice audits all ensure compliance, reduce liability, and protect margins.\r\n\r\nSupadock automates these high-accountability workflows while ensuring accuracy, compliance, and risk reduction. Our AI agents use cameras, voice, email, and document processing to handle tasks like verifying driver IDs, coordinating warehouse entry, assigning shipments to carriers, checking freight status, reconciling pickup and delivery paperwork, and following up on late invoices.\r\n",
