  "long_description": "When the public cloud appeared migration was easy. Existing apps running on physical servers could just be moved to virtual machines running in the cloud. The cloud is now moving towards serverless, and serverless is not backward compatible. New tools need to be created and existing apps need to be rewritten. Webiny provides developers with everything they need to build those serverless apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a 100% remote team.",
