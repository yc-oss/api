  "long_description": "Charge Running is a community for all runners. We host 20+ live virtual running classes and races per day, where runners join and run together from all over the world through a mobile app. Each class is hosted by a live, certified run coach, that tracks all participants' distances, paces, cadences, and interval summaries as they lead the runners via audio through effort-based run classes.\r\n\r\nEach runner can chat with the coach and other participants of the run, as well as see in real-time the distance of every other runner, no matter where they run from. This creates an incredibly motivational experience. \r\n\r\nIn addition to our daily lineup of classes, Charge hosts virtual races, partnering with race directors and charities to offer a virtual racing experience, with an in-person feel.
