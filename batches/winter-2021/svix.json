  "long_description": "Svix is the enterprise ready and open source webhooks service.\r\n\r\nWebhooks are a pain. Developers need to worry about deliverability, retries, monitoring and security. All of which are different for webhooks compared to the rest of the stack. We turn all of that into a simple API call.\r\n\r\nSvix is sending billions of webhooks for customers both large (Fortune 500) and small (startups), and is backed by Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Aleph, and founders and CTOs of companies such as Github, PagerDuty, Segment and Lookout.",
