  "long_description": "Sivo provides debt as a service. Our API and risk protocol allows fintechs, neobanks, and gig platforms to lend money to their users, at scale, without having to raise debt which can take up to two years. You can think of us as Stripe for Debt. \r\n\r\nWe started 6 months ago, in March signed a $100m debt capital partnership, and will be launching our API in April. We already have more than 100 companies in our customer pipeline including Uber. \r\n\r\nWe’ve been able to move so quickly because we are a team with previous exits and decades of experience in risk, debt, and enterprise software for companies including Goldman Sachs, Revolut, NASA, McKinsey and Citigroup.",
