These patients need their medications within days but currently it takes weeks because of complex, manual workflows that were built around poor data standards. \r\n\r\nAt Lamar Health, our mission is to get patients on therapy fast. Our customers are specialty pharmacies, infusion clinics and hospitals that are moving quickly to use AI to offset operational risks and gain competitive advantage. ",
