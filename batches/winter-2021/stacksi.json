  "long_description": "Stacksi helps companies automate the process of answering enterprise security questionnaires so they can close deals faster and save their best engineersâ€™ time for more strategic projects.\r\nSalespeople, CTOs, and CEOs of fast-growing enterprise startups can upload security questionnaires into our system. If the company already has written security policies, they can upload those documents, too. From there, Stacksi parses their documents, identifies gaps in their security policies vs. standards, and helps them establish a successful security program. \r\nUltimately, we will help them 1) automate completion of security questionnaires, 2) quickly get through enterprise security audits and 3) improve their security posture.",
