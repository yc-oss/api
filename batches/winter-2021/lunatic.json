  "long_description": "At the core of the company there is Lunatic, a runtime for developing low latency, robust and distributed networking applications. It can be used for web applications, game servers, video and voice chat, or other apps requiring low latency runtimes. Lunatic borrows many proven ideas from Go and Erlang, but also uses WebAssembly to make it easier targetable from existing languages, allowing teams to leverage already existing code and libraries.",
