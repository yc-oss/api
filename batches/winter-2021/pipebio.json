  "long_description": "Pipe|bio is the bioinformatics cloud for antibody / peptide screening & drug development.\r\n\r\nWe enable scientists to analyze and manage massive amounts of DNA sequencing data themselves without the need for bioinformaticians or programmers. The software is highly visual and enables you to overlay and filter information from different sources across your organization; be it assay data, sequence data or other process metadata. Insights from past results can be used to guide new experiments and they get better as you upload more and more data. Team leads get oversight and these capabilities combined empower organizations to find better drugs, faster.\r\n\r\nWe believe that science moves faster when scientists can curate and analyse their own data.",
