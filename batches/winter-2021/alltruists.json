Each box is themed around one big issue in the world - from homelessness to clean water to hunger to climate action and more - and guides kids to engage with that issue in positive, meaningful ways.\r\n\r\nIn each box:\r\n\r\nA proprietary mini-book to help kids learn about the issue at hand\r\n1-2 empathy-building activities to help kids connect with others' experiences\r\n1-2 unique volunteer projects designed with incredible nonprofit partners\r\nOnline giving experience where kids direct a $5 donation (included in the box) to one of three nonprofit partner projects\r\n(There are also a few surprises in each box, little things kids can keep as reminders or touchstones so they can easily reflect on the lessons learned.)",
