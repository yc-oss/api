  "long_description": "Axiom.ai is building a no-code browser automation tool. This lets anyone automate repetitive work by recording clicking and typing actions in their browser.\r\n\r\nWe think the market has huge potential - companies like UiPath built $10 billion+ businesses by automating processes on the desktop - an industry now known as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). We think RPA has a lot more potential outside the Enterprise. \r\n\r\nAxiom is on its way to being the industry-standard RPA tool for the browser. It now ranks alongside Selenium - the historical industry standard - as the top result when searching for ‘Browser Automation’ on Google, and is the top-result on Chrome’s extension store.\r\n\r\n",
