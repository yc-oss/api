  "long_description": "At Swadesi Way, we’re building an organic food brand movement that connects us back to real food. A few things set us apart:\r\n\r\n1. We source exclusively from organic small farmer collectives. No traders.\r\n\r\n2. We operate with capped margins: 60% to farmers, 30% to ops, 10% for overheads, ensuring fair value distribution \r\n\r\n3. We practice radical transparency: customers know where their food comes from, how it’s priced, and how much the farmer earns",
