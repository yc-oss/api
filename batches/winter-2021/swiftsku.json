  "long_description": "SwiftSku connects the $650B convenience store industry with management and analytics. \r\n\r\nSwiftSku’s app connects to point of sales at convenience stores in real time, enabling owners to remotely manage and monitor their stores. We take the guesswork out of running a convenience store with predictive analytics, dashboards, and reports.\r\n\r\nSwiftSku's CEO, Mit Patel, grew up managing the inventory, pricebook, and reporting of his family’s convenience stores, and, when vendors would come by, he’d bridge the language barrier as a translator.  More than 85% of independent convenience stores are owned by Indian families like Mit’s.\r\n\r\nSolving convenience store owners' pains of today leads to SwiftSku's greater vision of optimizing the supply chain, facilitating a retailer agnostic consumer to brand relationship, and providing real time insights to brands and retailers.",
