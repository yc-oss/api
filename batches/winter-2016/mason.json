  "long_description": "Mason is the fastest way to take smart devices from idea to end user. Whether building a single-use device from scratch or scaling a line of smart products, with Mason it’s 20x faster and 10x less costly to build, deploy and scale. Digital transformation is a modern requirement but operating a hardware-dependent initiative is hard – thousands of hours and millions of dollars are at stake.\r\n\r\nThe Mason Smart Device Platform is the only fully managed infrastructure for developing and delivering dedicated devices. It offers flexible usage-based pricing for fleets of devices and manages the underlying complexity of all associated backend services, making software delivery on a smart product line—whether it’s a tablet, wearable or new form factor—as simple as delivering software in the cloud. This frees innovators to focus on what matters: application development, feature specification and UX. Granular access to add, remove or lock down capabilities makes it possible for highly customized products to be built as envisioned.\r\n\r\nMason offloads hardware investment risks and logistics, including inventory procurement, warehousing and supply chain management. With options like zero-touch provisioning, devices can work perfectly out of the box without end user intervention. Remote fleet management, troubleshooting and automated software updates by Mason ensure security and positive end user experiences. Organizations of all sizes rely on Mason to bring innovations and hundreds of use cases to market without reinventing the wheel. Smarter from start to finish with Mason.™\r\n\r\nAWARDS\r\n* 2023: Best Places to Work & Best Startups to Work For, Built In Seattle\r\n* 2022: Best Places to Work & Best Small Places to Work, Built In Seattle\r\n* 2022: IoT Health & Wellness Innovation of the Year, IoT Breakthrough\r\n* 2022: Bronze Stevie® Award - Emerging Technology, The 2022 American Business Awards®\r\n* 2021: Deloitte Technology Fast 500™, Deloitte\r\n* 2019: Tech Impact Awards, Mobile - Silver, Seattle Business magazine\r\n\r\nFollow us on LinkedIn | https://www.linkedin.com/company/mason-america/",
