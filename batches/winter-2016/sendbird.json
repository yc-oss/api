We envision an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) world where AI agents connect businesses and individuals, empowering them to achieve more than ever before. It’s a future where the impossible becomes possible, and human achievement is no longer bound by time and cognitive load. We power over 300M+ people's conversations every month and we are working with the leading customers such as DoorDash, Match Group, Yahoo!, PayPal, Walgreens, and have raised $220M+ in total funding from ICONIQ, Tiger Global, Meritech, Emergence, SoftBank Vision Fund, Steadfast, Shasta, and August.",
