We provide a simple solution for managing artist logistics, collecting and tracking payments electronically, negotiating contracts and talent availabilities, and monitoring revenue goals.\r\n\r\nWe have been featured in TechCrunch, Billboard, DJ Mag, Mixmag, Hypebot, DJ Times, and Magnetic Magazine, and awarded the most promising startup from Nitey Awards and SF MusicTechâ€™s StartUp Innovators Challenge.",
