  "long_description": "Bodyport’s cardiovascular sensing weight scale and predictive algorithms detect early changes in cardiac function to help prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Bodyport is initially targeting heart failure, a chronic condition affecting over 6M Americans and a leading cause of hospitalizations (1M/year) and healthcare spending ($35B/year).\r\n\r\nBodyport’s novel scale measures cardiac output, congestion, heart rate, and other leading indicators of cardiovascular health — all in the same step patients already take to weigh themselves. Companion algorithms and software empower care teams to quickly identify at-risk patients and remotely optimize their therapy to prevent deterioration.",
