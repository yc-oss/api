  "long_description": "Reduced Energy Microsystems is building the most power-efficient silicon for embedded computer vision to bring visual intelligence to a whole new range of devices. By combining  proprietary asynchronous resilient technology with a custom neural network architecture, REM chips will handle state-of-the-art inference and traditional vision workloads in a tiny power envelope. REM makes  augmented reality, body-worn cameras, and autonomous robots smarter than ever before.",
