  "long_description": "TapZilla is a Y Combinator-backed company that launched October 13, 2010 and is taking the daily deal model and applying it to discounts on paid mobile apps.\n\nThrough TapZilla.com and AppRebates.com, the company has given out more than 25,000 paid applications to its users and has pioneered the method of connecting developers with users by giving away paid applications for free.\n\nTapZilla has been featured by TechCrunch and Forbes.\n\nEach day, TapZilla features a paid iOS app. To get the deal, the user clicks on the â€œget App Nowâ€ button, which will then prompt TapZilla to ask for your email. Users receive an email with a link to the app in the App Store where they can purchase the app and a coupon code.\n\nOnce the app is purchased and downloaded, users are prompted to enter the coupon code once inside the Appâ€™s interface. The app can also be prompted by shaking the phone. Once the code is entered, TapZilla automatically puts the app cost in the buyerâ€™s PayPal account or can issue an iTunes gift card.",
