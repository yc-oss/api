  "long_description": "Greentoe is a next generation e-commerce marketplace that enables consumers to set the price for the products they want to buy. Created to change the way people shop, Greentoe shakes up the traditional retail model by putting consumers in the driver's seat. They make an offer on a product and the site connects them to the retailers who are willing to accept the offer. The site benefits both consumers and retailers â€“ shoppers can buy products at the lowest price available while retailers reduce inventory and acquire new customers.",
