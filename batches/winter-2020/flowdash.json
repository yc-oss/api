  "long_description": "Flowdash makes it easy to build semi-automated workflows with no code. We recognize that many business processes today simply can't be fully automated and require human intuition. But there's no reason they need to be fully manual either. With Flowdash, teams can build custom tools to manage their internal processes, leveraging automation where it makes sense, and weaving in human intuition when needed.",
