  "long_description": "Menten AI designs protein drugs and enzymes using quantum computing and machine learning. Their technology leapfrogs current computational methods making it possible to design previously intractable proteins. The team created the first protein design algorithm for current and near-term quantum computers and created the world’s first protein designed on a quantum computer. They are now working on 3 new proteins, including a peptide to prevent the spread of viruses like Covid-19. They have 2 paid pilot projects with multinational chemical companies and 4 LOI’s with pharma and biotech companies.",
