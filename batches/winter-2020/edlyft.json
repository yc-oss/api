  "long_description": "Edlyft, backed by Kleiner Perkins, Kapor Capital, and YC, builds software that blue-chip enterprises like Google and Dropbox use to train college computer science students on essential skills required for the workforce, so they can be productive day one.\r\n\r\nIt takes new grad engineers 6-12 months to ramp up and add value to their company. Instead of relying on experienced engineers and wasting salary costs, Tinder and LinkedIn use Edlyft to train college CS students before theyâ€™re hired on skills to succeed in their role. \r\n\r\nCo-founders, Erika and Arnelle, are CS grads from Yale and Stanford, who have been featured by Forbes, TechCrunch and Business Insider for Edlyft. They're former engineers at Facebook and Google, and an ex-LinkedIn product manager and Bain consultant. ",
