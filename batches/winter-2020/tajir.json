  "long_description": "In Pakistan, stores struggle to buy inventory. Stores waste hours dealing with dozens of suppliers and wait passively for salesmen to visit their stores. Deliveries are often late, incorrect, or never arrive at all. Stores often learn prices at the point of delivery and cannot compare across different suppliers.\r\n\r\nTajir solves this by offering a one-stop shop for all inventory purchasing with low prices, huge selection, and the convenience of 24/7 ordering with next-day delivery.\r\n\r\nMom-and-pop stores are the arteries of Pakistan's economy. Through empowering them with world class logistics & information tools, Tajir aims to refactor and simplify Pakistan's retail economy.",
