A desktop recording SDK\r\n3. A mobile recording SDK\r\n\r\nWe integrate with meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and more, as well as in-person meetings.\r\n\r\nOver 1000 companies rely on our API today to process millions of hours of meeting data. We provide stable infrastructure that typically takes engineering teams 6+ months of time to build, and help our customers get up and running in days instead of months.",
