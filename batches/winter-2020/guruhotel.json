  "long_description": "GuruHotel is building the AI-native booking protocol that will power direct hotel reservations in the next decade, effectively becoming \"Stripe for hotel bookings\" and ending OTAs' $370B stranglehold on hospitality distribution.\r\n\r\nFor 25 years, hotel ecommerce has been broken. Independent hotels lack the infrastructure to sell directly online, forcing them to pay OTAs 20-40% commissions on 40-60% of their bookings. Hotel websites don't convert (<0.5% vs. 5-10% in modern ecommerce), booking engines redirect users, payments are fragmented, and inventory is trapped in legacy PMS systems.\r\n\r\nMore critically: AI agents cannot book hotels directly today. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, none can complete a hotel transaction end-to-end because inventory isn't exposed in a machine-readable format.\r\n\r\nGuruHotel has built the complete solution: a full-stack ecommerce platform (website + native booking engine + checkout + payments + AI-ready APIs) that integrates directly with hotel PMS systems, enabling both humans and AI agents to book directly.\r\n",
