  "long_description": "Abalone Bio is tackling challenging undrugged targets underlying diseases affecting millions, focusing first cell-specific antibody drugs to treat obesity and metabolic disease without the GI side effects that cause 25% of GLP-1 drug patients to quit after 1 year. \r\n\r\n+ High throughput experimental measurement uniquely leverages AI/ML:  We’ve engineered cells to measure antibodies for pharmacological activity, not just structure or binding like others, 100 million at a time, 100X+ the throughput of others. With our large, proprietary activity datasets, we uniquely leverage ML to both unlock the discovery of rare hits and generate optimized hits for challenging targets, starting with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)\r\n\r\n+ Proven success: We have developed antibody agonists (activators) for 2 out of the 8 G-protein coupled receptors ever drugged by biotech.\r\n\r\n+ Pharma traction: We’ve secured 3 partnerships with $3M in revenue and $125M in downstream value. \r\n\r\n+ Externally validated science: We’ve been awarded $7M in non-dilutive grant funding for platform and program development.",
