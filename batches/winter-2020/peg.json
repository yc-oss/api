  "long_description": "Peg is a global bank account replacement using stablecoins.\r\nWe make it possible to send money to any email or phone number in the world in seconds.\r\n\r\nWe have taken all the friction out of the current terrible UX with crypto p2p payments and made it better than regular consumer products like Venmo and Square Cash. Unlike those it works across borders and can launch globally due to our non-custodial architecture.\r\n\r\nPeg was the first self-custodial stablecoin focused wallet, launched early 2020.\r\n",
