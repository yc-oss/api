  "long_description": "Our overarching mission is to accelerate the global mass-market adoption of consumer biotech products so every human can live at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nOur immediate focus is excess bodyweight. We are accelerating the global take-up of GLP-1 medications by increasing their accessibility to help solve obesity worldwide.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\r\n\r\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >40x since Aug 2023. We’re serving >50k customers with high NPS. We’re >$100M/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023.\r\n\r\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started. This is still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about working at Aios Medical here: https://fella.notion.site/working-at-aios-medical",
