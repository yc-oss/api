Listeners who sign up are given a daily number of \"hearts\" they can use to vote on songs they like. If songs you heart become popular, you earn reputation points, level up, and unlock community abilities. Listeners can also earn achievement badges for various activities, like hearting songs in under-explored genres or reaching a playcount milestone. All tracks are fully streamable and can be organized in tag-based playlists. To lubricate the experience, they've invented an ajax navigation system that allows listeners to enjoy seamless audio playback across pageviews.",
