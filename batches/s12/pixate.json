Pixate's flagship product, the Pixate Engine for iOS, integrates a CSS-based styling engine, graphics rendering system, and a SVG-subset for supporting scalable vector graphics. The CSS-based stylings can be changed at run-time and can be downloaded and updated on-demand. The Pixate Engine for iOS version 1.0 is currently available for purchase or for trial download at pixate.com. Pixate was a Y-Combinator Summer 2012 participant and raised early funding through a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012.",
