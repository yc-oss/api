  "long_description": "WakeMate makes personalized alarm clocks that sync with both a user's body and their cell phone, enabling the iPhone alarm system to sound at the end of a REM cycle.\n\nThe application/ wristband system also provides a full sleep analysis on their Analytics Platform.\n\nThe WakeMate uses a science called actigraphy to analyze your sleep. Actigraphy uses an actigraph (the WakeMate unit) placed on a subjectâ€™s wrist to monitor the motion. The motion data is then analyzed to determine sleep patterns and circadian rhythms of the subject.\n\nWakeMate was funded by the startup incubator Y Combinator.",
