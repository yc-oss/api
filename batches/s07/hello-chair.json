  "long_description": "Hello, Chair Inc. was founded in 2006 by Luke Iannini, Mike Jacobs and Kevin Corcoran to explore opportunities in applied machine learning and internet advertising. After receiving funding from Y-Combinator in 2007, we produced Adpinion, one of the first advertising networks to utilize user feedback to drive personalized targeting.\n\nOur core technology — the recommendation engine called SparseReduce — has since proved infinitely adaptable in such diverse problem domains as Amazon product recommendation, eBay auction discovery, image and language comprehension, and Twitter stream exploration.\n\nThe latest application of SparseReduce is Appsaurus, an app discovery platform which was released on the eve of 2010 to overwhelming critical acclaim.\n\nWe're backed by some pretty incredible investors: Harrison Metal, Mitch Kapor, Chris Sacca, Y-Combinator and David Parker to name a few. We're also proud to have Alexis Ohanian as an advisor.",
