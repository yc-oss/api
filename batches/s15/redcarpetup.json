Currently we are one of the largest issuers of credit lines to the new-to-credit customer in India.\r\nIn a population base of 800 million people with bank accounts, there are less than 40 million credit cards. \r\nBy building a fullstack SDK for card issuance, underwriting as well as holding capital & collection ops, we are looking to build the Capital One of India.\r\n",
