  "long_description": "What we do?\r\n\r\nWe develop digital therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in hematology and oncology. \r\n\r\nHow it works?\r\n\r\nFirst we build networks of doctors and patients designed to track, predict and prevent disease. Second, we validate the safety and efficacy of our interventions in pivotal clinical studies to obtain regulatory clearance (SaMD). Finally, we aim to commercialize our products as prescription digital therapeutics (DTx).\r\n\r\nWhere are we now?\r\n\r\nToday, we are the standard in digital hematology:\r\n\r\n* Our hemophilia network covers 33% of all patients and providers in the US. \r\n* We bested 20+ competitors, including several Fortune 500 companies. \r\n* Our clients include: Sanofi, Bayer, Novo Nordisk, Biogen, and Roche.
