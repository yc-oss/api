  "long_description": "Carefully engineered software to get products to your customers across the world faster and on time. We're trusted to simplify e-commerce and logistics by building the necessary tools for companies to improve their operations. These include determining key shipping routes, understanding customer demand, or reducing shipping and material costs.\r\n\r\nWe built Shotput so that people can use new technologies to manage work across companies which will allow them to precisely calculate costs & time. We'll enter a world where people no longer have to work on boring tasks of calling each other to find statuses or putting things into a box all day. Instead we can be free to think strategically about what we're building, who's the customer, and how to best serve their needs.",
