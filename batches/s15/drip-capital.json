  "long_description": "Drip is a digital trade finance startup.  Trade finance is an age-old paper-based industry dominated by banks that focus on large, established corporate customers. Today, however, small businesses account for 40% of trade, but still remain neglected by banks. Drip is using technology to re-build core parts of the trade finance infrastructure and make the underwriting and financing of B2B transactions seamless for small businesses. Our mission is to level the playing field for small businesses and to finance their trade at the click of a button.\r\n\r\nDrip consists of experts in both finance and technology and has offices in Palo Alto and Mumbai. Drip is backed by top tier investors Accel,  Sequoia, Wing, Initialized and Y Combinator.",
