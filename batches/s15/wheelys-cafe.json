  "long_description": "Wheelys is a chain of organic bicycle cafés that enables young people to start their own cafés. Since starting last year, Wheelys has sold over 800 cafés in 75 countries, which means it’s growing faster than any fast food chain. Ever. \r\n\r\nWheelys vision is to make it easier for passionate people without money to open their own cafés, shops, and restaurants. \r\n\r\nWheelys was hosted at Y Combinator (the accelerator behind Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit) and has been funded by, among others, Othman Laraki (Color Genomics), Paul Buchheit (creator of Gmail), Jared Friedman (founder of Scribd), and Justin Waldron (co-founder of Zynga).\r\n\r\n“We will break the hegemony of the industrial fast food chains, and pave the way for an organic revolution. Helping us to do this is young hungry eco entrepreneurs from all over the world.”\r\nMaria De La Croix, co-founder of Wheelys",
