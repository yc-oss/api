  "long_description": "Polymath is building a general autonomy stack for cautious vehicles.  Our software allows any industrial vehicle - whether it's a tractor in a field or a bulldozer in a mine, drive itself.  We bundle together AI, ML, Controls, ROS, Safety and best-in-class deployment practices to enable our customers to tell automated vehicles to do via a REST API.\r\n\r\nWe're on more robots than we have engineers, are seeing our revenue (and robotic fleet) grow rapidly, and are looking for folks who want to help automate the world.",
