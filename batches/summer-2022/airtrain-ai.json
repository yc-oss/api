  "long_description": "Airtrain AI is a no-code data platform for Large Language Models.\r\n\r\nProprietary AI models such as GPT-4 are very powerful but also very costly, slow, unreliable, and unsecured.\r\n\r\nAs businesses look to scale their AI prototypes into production-grade products, they struggle with large AI bills, slow APIs and large failure rates.\r\nOn the other hand, smaller language models have been proven to be able to perform on-part with large ones with fine-tuned on high-quality datasets.\r\n\r\nAirtrain AI lets AI practitioners explore alternatives to proprietary models, build up training datasets, evaluate, fine-tune, and serve a large selection of open-source LLMs.",
