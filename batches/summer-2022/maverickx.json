  "long_description": "MaverickX is a chemical technology company advancing natural resource extraction. The company was founded by Eric Herrera, former Department of Defense scientist,  and Jesse Evans, former startup operations manager. \r\n\r\nAs resources become more difficult to extract across the energy and mining sectors, new technologies are needed. MaverickX has a portfolio of chemical solutions -- PetroX and LithX -- to enhance recovery of oil from shale reservoirs and metals from low-grade ores. \r\n\r\nMore oil. More metal. Better chemistry.\r\n\r\n",
