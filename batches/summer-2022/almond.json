  "long_description": "Almond is like One Medical but for womenâ€™s health: we make it easy to get great ObGyn care fast, both at our in-person offices and over telehealth.\r\n\r\nThe problem with traditional ObGyn practices is that physician time is misused, so patients get slow care. We're rebuilding back-office tech that saves physicians time, and we're hiring a wider range of care providers roles, which let us deliver better outcomes to patients and reduce the amount of time it takes to get their issue resolved.",
