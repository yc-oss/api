  "long_description": "Create new slides or upgrade existing ones with AI that works natively inside PowerPoint and stays true to your company’s branding, templates, and standards.\r\n\r\nHow Slidely AI is different -\r\n\r\n1. Works directly in PowerPoint\r\nNative PPTX support — no HTML-to-PPT hacks, exports, or broken layouts.\r\n\r\n2. Improves slides you already have\r\nBecause it understands real PowerPoint files, Slidely AI can rewrite, redesign, and tighten existing decks — not just generate new ones.\r\n\r\n3. Agentic, consulting-grade output\r\nUnlike other tools which can only use simple templates, Slidely AI agent puts each shape individually on slides to express your complex data.\r\n\r\n4. Truly on-brand, every time\r\nLearns from your past decks to follow your colors, fonts, layouts, and slide patterns — so every slide looks like it came from you, not a generic AI tool.",
