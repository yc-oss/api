  "long_description": "Birch Biosciences engineers enzymes for plastic recycling using synthetic biology and machine learning.  Our enzymes function as high performance “molecular scissors” that efficiently break down plastic polymers into chemical building blocks that can be used to manufacture high quality recycled plastic products.   Today, plastic manufacturing  is unsustainable and a major driver of climate change.   Birch Biosciences is developing an economical end-to-end plastic recycling process that reduces carbon emissions by 70% and enables a circular plastic economy.\r\n",
