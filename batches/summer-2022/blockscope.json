  "long_description": "Blockscope is a Web3 data platform that enables anyone interested in on-chain data to quickly spin up live or historical data pipelines (for blocks, event, transaction, wallets, token, NFTs, etc). Similar to AWS, users have access to variety of managed software services to analyze, interact with or inject captured data into their apps.\r\n\r\nOur platform is built around the core idea of off-loading the on-chain data that our customers need for their Web3 apps, and reliably storing them for quick access/use.\r\n\r\nWe offer products on top of the core data we index for our customers. Some of these services are contract analytics, wallet profiling, events & transactions database as a service, push notifications, webhooks, and developer tools.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to enable everyone to easily access and consume on-chain data!",
