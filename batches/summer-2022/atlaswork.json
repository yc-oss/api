  "long_description": "Atlas helps enterprise real estate firms managing $50M+ make real-time decisions by unifying their data. \r\n\r\nCurrently, analysts at a $100M real estate portfolio spend 60+ hours a month manually copying and pasting exports from incompatible systems into a master spreadsheet. This process slows decision-making and costs up to 10% of Net Operating Income (NOI) annually. \r\n\r\nAtlas ingests these chaotic file exports to automatically unify the data, audit for financial leakage, and generate real-time reporting. It replaces weeks of manual work with instant truth.",
