  "long_description": "Tailor is the headless ERP that gives fast-growing retail brands a composable, API-first platform to run operations with speed, flexibility, and control.\r\n\r\nüß± Legacy ERP is too rigid: Systems like NetSuite and SAP take months (or years) to implement and break with every change. Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\nüß© Point solutions don‚Äôt scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can‚Äôt talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\nüìä Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n‚ö°Ô∏è Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\nüëü Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe‚Äôre proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",
