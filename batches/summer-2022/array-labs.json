  "long_description": "We're designing swarms of tiny satellites which will work together to create the first real-time, high-resolution 3D model of the earth. \r\n\r\nBy using clusters of satellites to image the same place on the earth at the exact same time, we can improve image quality by more than 60x over conventional techniques. \r\n\r\nThis technology will massively increase the amount of affordable, high-quality 3D data, enabling a host of new applications across an array of industries, including AR/XR/Autonomy, Defense, Climate/ESG, and Insurance Analytics. \r\n",
