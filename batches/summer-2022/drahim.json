  "long_description": "\"Drahim\" is a slang for money in Arabic (from the ancient Greek Drachma).\r\n\r\nThe app integrates with banks and provides individuals meaningful spending insights and generates auto savings and investment advice.\r\n\r\nFor the meaningful insights, the app integrates with banks and automatically categorizes all of your transactions (All of your accounts in one place) and spots spending patterns and behaviors.\r\n\r\nDrahim then suggests a saving and investing plan that allows the user to continue living comfortably and to keep spending guilt-free.\r\n\r\nOur focus is not necessarily to save you money, rather we grow your money discreetly. Drahim allows you to continue spending but feeling way better doing it.",
