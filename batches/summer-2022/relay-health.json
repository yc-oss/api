  "long_description": "Nearly 7 billion hours are spent on porn every year.\r\n\r\nRelay provides a modern solution to one of the most widespread yet hidden epidemics of our time: pornography. Despite being one of the biggest drains on focus, relationships, and mental health, it remains one of the most silent and stigmatized problems in society. We are tackling this head-on.\r\n\r\nRelay helps people break free through private, anonymous groups that provide accountability and community. Members join a small, confidential team that replaces isolation with connection, offering shame-free accountability, evidence-based tools, and daily reflection.\r\n\r\nOur mission goes beyond quitting porn. Relay exists to help people heal the isolation and pain that drive destructive habitsâ€”so they can rebuild intimacy, reclaim focus, and live with greater connection, purpose, and wholeness.",
