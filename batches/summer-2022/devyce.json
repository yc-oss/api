  "long_description": "Devyce is building the global mobile network for business. Right now, we give your employees a business phone number in an app, on their personal phone, instantly, alongside a portal for analytics, management and integrations.\r\n\r\nNick has a background in recruiting and real estate and understands the pain points these industries face with hybrid working, while Ed has a solid tech background including a CS degree from Cambridge. Because of our relationship with a mobile network operator, we have the unfair advantage that we will actually become a mobile network, unlike other SaaS VoIP providers.\r\n\r\nhttps://devyce.com/",
