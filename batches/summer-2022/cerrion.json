  "long_description": "Cerrion helps manufacturers automatically detect, understand and eliminate problems on their production lines using video-based Computer Vision. Our AI leverages standard CCTV cameras and learns how a manufacturing process looks like when things are going well and can automatically detect and track problems in real-time.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of our customers, a Pepsi supplier producing 500 bottles per minute now automatically detects and reacts to a fallen bottle before it starts blocking their production line.
