  "long_description": "Firecrawl is a web data infrastructure platform that converts websites into clean, structured data optimized for AI applications through a simple API. Originally built as an internal tool at Mendable to solve their own data ingestion challenges, the team recognized the broader need for reliable web data extraction and transformed it into a standalone product. The platform combines web search, scraping, and AI-powered parsing into a unified solution, focusing on the core developer priorities of reliability, speed, and ease of use. By abstracting away the complexities of web data extraction, Firecrawl serves as the foundational data layer that enables AI applications to seamlessly access and process web content in the exact format they need.",
