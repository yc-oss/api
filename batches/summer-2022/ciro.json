  "long_description": "Meet your new AI prospecting agent — powered by Ciro.\r\n\r\nSales reps today juggle a lot — hundreds of daily cold calls, LinkedIn follow-ups, email sequences — all while trying to sound human and build real connections. \r\n\r\nBefore any of that, they spend hours trying to figure out who to reach out to.\r\n\r\nIt’s a constant battle between speed and quality — and under pressure, speed usually wins.\r\n\r\nBut in the age of AI, we don’t think that tradeoff should exist.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we built Ciro Autopilot — to help you build high-quality lead lists, faster than ever.",
