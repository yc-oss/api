  "long_description": "Energy demand is skyrocketing, and renewable energy is the most scalable path forward. But today’s development process can’t move fast enough to meet global goals.\r\n\r\nPaces exists to change that. We are building software and services to accelerate renewable energy deployment and lower costs - unlocking one of the greatest opportunities of our time: transforming how infrastructure gets built and ensuring it’s built with renewable energy.\r\n\r\nPaces automates early-stage due diligence and provides the expertise to accelerate late-stage diligence, fast-tracking projects from siting to construction-ready. Our platform supports renewable energy and data center developers, real estate firms, and more by streamlining siting, interconnection, and permitting. With Paces, teams can de-risk decisions, shorten timelines, and get more renewable energy projects built.",
