  "long_description": "Velontra is building a hypersonic space plane that can takeoff from anywhere in any weather.  This horizontal takeoff increases launch reliability and enables customers to directly access any orbit.  Our air-breathing propulsion system is up to 6 times more fuel efficient than any rocket, and uses oxygen from the air which creates thousands of pounds of additional payload capacity. \r\n\r\nWe have millions in current government/commercial contracts and LOI’s. \r\n\r\nWe have assembled a team of industry experts, government senior executives, and a NASA astronaut. \r\n\r\nThe hypersonic space plane will work by taking off from any runway with a jet propulsion system.  Next, it will climb to over 100,000’ and Mach 5.  At this point, it will launch a 2nd stage rocket directly into the desired Low Earth Orbit. \r\n\r\nVelontra is “boldly going where no one has gone before.”",
