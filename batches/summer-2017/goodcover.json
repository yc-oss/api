  "long_description": "Goodcover provides its Members with Good Renters Insurance for 50% less than legacy companies and an Annual Dividend of the money left over after claims obligations are met.\r\n\r\nGoodcover is a Managing General Agent (MGA) that administers personal insurance on behalf of our Membership, a bit like how USAA does it.\r\n\r\nMember's premiums are pooled and used to pay claims.  We take a fixed fee, and the remainder is returned in our Annual Member Dividend.\r\n\r\nWe work with multi-billion dollar capital partners to ensure regulations are followed, adequate claims capital is always available, and we have emergency capacity for catastrophes.\r\n\r\nTechnology allows us to eliminate waste, saving roughly 25% of the cost.  We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.\r\n\r\nAs an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our \"Marketing Budget\" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\r\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.\r\n\r\nOur granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:\r\n    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor\r\n    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)\r\n    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)\r\n    - added coverage for mold removal\r\n\r\nOur MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, \"renting\" capacity as we need it.\r\n\r\nAll this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors.
