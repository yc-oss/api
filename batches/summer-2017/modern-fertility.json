  "long_description": "We're a women’s health company making personalized reproductive health information more accessible, earlier in life. We make the same laboratory tests that were previously confined to fertility clinics more accessible for women at home. By arming women with powerful information about their reproductive health, Modern Fertility is closing the fertility information gap and enabling women to own the decisions impacting their bodies and futures. We've raised $22 million from Forerunner Ventures, Maveron, Union Square Ventures, First Round Capital, #Angels and Y Combinator.\r\n",
