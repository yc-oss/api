  "long_description": "Skyscrape makes temperature responsive fabrics for a new type of clothing. These fabrics literally change shape in response to a change in temperature: the fabrics become thicker and insulate more as the temperature drops, and they become thinner and insulate less as the temperature rises again. This \"intelligent insulation\" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. \r\n\r\nSkyscrapeâ€™s fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.\r\n\r\nSkyscrape's first market entry was with Ralph Lauren in the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.",
