  "long_description": "Over 80% of maternal mortalities were preventable with earlier intervention. Currently, doctors miss >50% of moms who have life-threatening complications and wait until labor to start doing manual risk assessments, at which point it's too late.\r\n\r\nElythea's proprietary ML models catch life-threatening obstetric complications (like postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia/eclampsia, emergency c-section, preterm labor, and more) as soon as the first visit. We automatically analyze relevant demographic and clinical risk factors, flag high-risk patients, and provide evidence-based interventions, giving doctors months in advance to intervene and prevent complications from ever happening.\r\n\r\nOur global clinical studies have shown that we can catch 3x more complications than clinical judgment 10x sooner.
