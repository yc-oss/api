  "long_description": "PropRise is building the AI operating system for commercial real estate investing. We automate the entire workflow from sourcing to closing: our AI finds deals nationwide that match your criteria, then populates your Excel models in an instant. CRE teams currently waste 80% of their time on manual tasks and miss profitable deals because they can't analyze fast enough. Major firms like Colliers and Public Storage already use us to analyze 7x more deals. We're creating the first end-to-end platform that acts as the system of autonomy, intelligence, and record for the $20 trillion CRE market.",
