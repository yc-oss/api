  "long_description": "We use generative AI to call insurance on behalf of healthcare clinics. We save clinics up to 40 hours of calls every week over existing outsourced human solutions. \r\n\r\nCompared to the existing solutions for benefits verifications: \r\n- We're faster -- by default, we have a turnaround of 24 hours compared to typically a 3 day turnaround for competitors\r\n- We can reach more payors -- as long as they have a phone line, we can support calling them for benefits. There's quite a few payors in both medical and dental (e.g. Seledent) that have yet to offer a digital retrieval of benefits\r\n- We're reliable and consistent -- there is no person-to-person variation or question skipping when it comes to working with software\r\n",
