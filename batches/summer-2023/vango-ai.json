  "long_description": "We built Vango excited by the future where generative visual AI models like stable diffusion dramatically reduce the barrier to create content. While spending 8 months building products for creatives, we found ourselves building hacky tools to address many of frustrations we had with visual AI. \r\n\r\nSo we decided to build the devtool we needed: Vango is a flexible evaluation platform that makes it 10x improve visual models. Developers using visual AI models at scale use Vango to learn quantitative ways to improve their model, saving them ~10 hours per week. \r\n\r\nMajor companies building visual products have already begun integrating diffusion models, including Adobe, Disney, Activision Blizzard, Canva, and Snap. By 2025, it is estimated that 1 billion images per day will be AI-generated. ",
