  "long_description": "Deasy Labs was acquired by Collibra in July 2025 (global leader in enterprise data governance).\r\n\r\nDeasy Labs provides metadata orchestration for AI workflows. Deasie's platform provides the best way for AI teams to create and embed high-quality, customized metadata into their AI workflows (e.g., RAG, Agentic frameworks).\r\n\r\nOur three founders (from Amazon, McKinsey/QuantumBlack & MIT) previously built an ML data governance tool from 0 to 1 within McKinsey, which we deployed with 11 Fortune 500 companies. We saw in early 2023 the ability to create high-quality metadata (without reliance on domain experts) would be a key factor in achieving the accuracy & speed in GenAI applications required for production.  \r\n\r\nOur investors include General Catalyst, Y Combinator, RTP Global and world experts in enterprise data.
