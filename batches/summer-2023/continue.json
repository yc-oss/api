  "long_description": "Writing code got 10x faster. Shipping it didn't. Continue closes the gap. What good looks like on your team, enforced automatically.\r\n\r\nDevelopers are drowning in AI-generated code. Continuous AI solves this by automating the workflows around code, not just the code itself. The role of the software engineer is shifting from prompting AI to designing processes that run automatically.\r\n\r\nWith hundreds of thousands of users, Continue is loved by developers worldwide at organizations ranging from small startups to Fortune 500 companies. Continue has raised $5.1M from Heavybit, Y Combinator, and angel investors. The company was founded in 2023 and is based in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe believe the time is now to create a future where developers are amplified, not automated.\r\n\r\nhttps://continuousai.com",
