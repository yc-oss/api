  "long_description": "Trayd is a B2B construction payroll platform and back office management system designed for same-day pay. We allow the 7M construction workers in the US to get access to their earned wages 7-10 days sooner than legacy payroll providers. With a unique spin on traditional payroll, Trayd is on a mission to create back office efficiencies for commercial subcontractors while simultaneously addressing the significant labor shortage affecting the $2.1TR North American construction industry. \r\n\r\nTrayd is bigger than construction payroll. It's the promise that the hardest working people get access to their money, as and when they need it, creating greater financial wellness across the board. Not only that, we are pioneering digital cash access for a demographic traditionally overlooked while simultaneously modernizing operations in an industry that has been slow to adapt. The challenges and opportunities with Trayd are abundant, promising an engaging journey ahead.",
