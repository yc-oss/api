  "long_description": "Taylor is the control panel for enriching unstructured text in real-time. Business leaders and developers use Taylor to label and build products around their free text without the infrastructure and maintenance overhead. \r\n\r\nWhy Taylor? Our customers previously relied on LLMs for tagging, extracting, and enriching data. They soon hit rate limits, high latency, and accuracy issues (LLMs are optimized for generative tasks, not structured high-accuracy workflows). With Taylor, teams get access to our proprietary models purpose-built for text classification and entity extraction. ",
