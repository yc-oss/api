  "long_description": "Silimate is the copilot for chip designers; it finds and fixes functional and PPA issues in your chip designs.\r\n\r\nToday, chip teams spend most of their 12-18 month design cycles converging slowly to functional correctness and their targeted PPA (power/performance/area). With Silimate, chip designers create correct, PPA-converged RTL code in minutes and eliminate months from their tape out schedule.",
