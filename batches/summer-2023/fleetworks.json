  "long_description": "FleetWorks is building a vertical AI agent that powers a massive, overlooked marketplace: matching trucks with jobs.\r\n\r\nEvery year, companies spend over $1 trillion moving freight across the country, but the process is still slow, manual, and chaotic. It often takes dozens of back-and-forth calls and messages just to find and book a single truck. FleetWorks replaces all of that manual work with an AI enabled marketplace that matches trucks with jobs",
