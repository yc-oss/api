  "long_description": "FleetWorks is rebuilding the $1 trillion freight marketplace with AI.\r\n\r\nEvery year, companies spend over a trillion dollars moving freight across the U.S. — but the system for matching trucks with jobs is still slow, manual, and fragmented.\r\n\r\nFleetWorks is fixing that. We’re turning today’s chaotic freight market into a modern, intelligent marketplace — one where AI agents replace the endless phone calls, texts and emails and match jobs to trucks instantly.",
