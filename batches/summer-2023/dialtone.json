  "long_description": "Dialtone helps enterprises transform cross-functional, cross-system tasks into intelligent, self-running AI agents - all with your existing enterprise security controls. Companies across technology, sports and entertainment, healthcare, finance, and retail deploy Dialtone Agents to automate both internal operations and customer-facing processes.\r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart:\r\n1. Agentic AI delivered on day one: Our platform couples cutting-edge AI infrastructure with built-in reliability, security, and observability so teams can launch production-grade agents in days, not months.\r\n2. White-glove engineering included: Dedicated engineering support to help end-to-end, from scoping to launch to continuous optimization - at no extra cost.\r\n3. Success over software: We measure our impact by real business outcomes, not seat counts. If our agents aren’t moving the needle, we’re not done.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n1.No-code Agent Builder - Design, test, deploy, and run agents in an intuitive UI anyone can use. All backed by Dialtone’s best-in-class AI infrastructure and agent orchestration platform.\r\n2. Humans in the loop - Employees can seamlessly collaborate with agents when human input or oversight is required.\r\n3. Triggers + Surfaces - Configure agents to run on integration events, time based schedules, or arbitrary webhooks - all in an easy-to-use UI. Or, use and talk with agents from your existing chat and email surfaces.\r\n4. Integrations Library - 100+ (and counting) first-party data, action, and event connectors for the software and tools you already depend on.\r\n5. Observability - View every step of any agentic flow with easily parseable real-time logs and traces for rapid debugging, optimization, and auditing.\r\n6. Custom Integrations + API - Extend agents with your proprietary systems and software using your existing OpenAPI specs and MCP servers. Need even more customization? Programmatically create, orchestrate, and monitor agents from your own codebase.\r\n",
