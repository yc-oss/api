  "long_description": "Spine is the unlimited visual workspace where your ideas can branch, run in parallel, and stay in view. Instead of being trapped in a linear chat thread, you think in blocks, not threads—chat, deep research, images, memos—each block holding its own context while sharing it across the canvas.\r\n\r\nConnect and orchestrate GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama and hundreds more like instruments in a symphony, all without losing your train of thought. Chat is great for Q&A; it’s terrible for thinking. Spine fixes that by letting context flow visually between blocks so your flow state never breaks.\r\n\r\nExtend this thinking to structured workflows that you can set up across 1000+ apps.\r\n\r\nReclaim your creative power. The age of prompt engineering is ending; the future of thinking is visual, collaborative, and unlimited—and it lives on Spine.",
