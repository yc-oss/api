  "long_description": "Atla is the eval and improvement platform for AI agents. \r\n\r\nWe help developers cut time spent on manually reviewing traces. Atla’s LLM judge evaluates your agent step-by-step, uncovers error patterns across runs, and suggests specific fixes—so you know exactly what to fix and why.\r\n\r\nAtla supports the most popular agent frameworks teams build with, including LangChain, CrewAI, and OpenAI Agents. With real-time monitoring, automated error detection, and prompt experimentation, Atla gives teams the visibility and control needed to confidently ship agentic systems that work. \r\n\r\nWe’re a team of researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs and operational leaders. Our expertise in evals was honed through training our own purpose-built LLM Judges, Selene and Selene Mini, which are available open-source and have been downloaded 40,000+ times.",
