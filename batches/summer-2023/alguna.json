  "long_description": "We are Alguna, building a modern platform that helps B2B companies price deals, send quotes, bill customers, and collect payments - all in one place.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to create the most efficient revenue engine for B2B SaaS.\r\n\r\nToday, many companies run these processes with spreadsheets and a patchwork of separate tools. That leads to slow approvals, manual work, mistakes, and missed revenue—especially as pricing gets more complex.\r\n\r\nAlguna replaces that mess by connecting the entire flow from **quote to cash**: what sales sells becomes what finance bills, automatically. We help teams automate invoicing, handle usage-based or custom pricing, and reduce back-and-forth between sales, finance, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe result: growth-stage startups and enterprises can close deals faster, bill accurately, and scale revenue operations without adding headcount or building internal systems.\r\n",
