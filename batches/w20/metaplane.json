Data teams at Bose, Ramp, and Klaviyo use our data observability platform to prevent and detect data issues — before the CEO pings them about weird revenue numbers.\r\n\r\nWe do this with ML-based anomaly detection, end-to-end column-level lineage, and tools to help prevent incidents before they occur. You can monitor your entire data stack within 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe company is backed by Khosla Ventures, Y Combinator, and the founders of Okta, HubSpot, and Vercel.",
