  "long_description": "Carupi is the world's 1st lightly managed peer-to-peer digital marketplace (\"C2C\"), like Airbnb, for used cars, allowing individuals to safely and conveniently buy and sell cars from home with the push of a button. Differently from pure marketplaces such as craigslist, we take care of every transaction end-to-end (as 'concierges'), from taking car photos at the user's place to advertising his car, managing offers, taking his car (fully insured) to buyers for free at-home test drives, handling paperwork and payment. And differently from dealers or dealer-like companies, we don't use any physical infrastructure or need to buy cars for inventory.",
