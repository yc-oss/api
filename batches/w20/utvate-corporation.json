  "long_description": "We dream of a world in which every person can access the information they need in order to live a prosperous life. \r\n\r\nUpcoming generations of satellites are going to make this dream come true! In recent years, there have been major innovations in the way satellites are manufactured and launched into space. However, the equipment used to communicate with the satellites, i.e. the user terminal, has not benefited from the same rate of innovation. Advanced user terminal solutions are essential for individuals at home, businesses, or moving platforms such as cars, airplanes, or ships in need of uninterrupted connectivity. \r\n\r\nUTVATE is here to build the next generation of user terminals that can unlock the true capacity of satellite internet!",
