  "long_description": "Isabl has developed software that can analyze the entire genome of cancer patients.\r\n\r\nToday, when people get cancer, they get a genetic test of their tumor that analyzes only a few possible mutations. With Isabl, you run the tumor through an Illumina sequencer and get the whole genome, then our software is able to analyze all the mutations.\r\n\r\nOur breakthrough technology provides unprecedented clarity into tumor biology to aid treatment planning. This opens up opportunities for precision diagnostics, disease surveillance and biomarker discovery.",
