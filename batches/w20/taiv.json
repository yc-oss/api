Our proprietary AI model analyzes the live video feed and intelligently switches sources during commercial breaks, show changes, or based on the time of day, to show the best possible content & ads for any environment.\r\n\r\nWe offer this for free to venues and make money by selling ads, which we rev-share back with the venue, turning their TVs from a cost center to a profit center.
