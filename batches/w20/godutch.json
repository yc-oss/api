  "long_description": "goDutch is a new-age fintech app that powers group payments for millennials. We’re on a mission to reimagine group payments and enable people to enjoy with their friends without any worry of awkward reminders, delayed payments, and multiple transactions.\r\n\r\nWe've first-hand seen that group payments are very tedious - one person first pays on behalf of the entire group, then calculates and makes a note of who owes whom how much, and then individually reminds each person to pay back. At goDutch, we are passionately working towards re-imagining this multi-step process that extends over numerous days and multiple apps. Our focus is on being design-led and driving cutting-edge fintech innovation.\r\n\r\ngoDutch is founded by IIT Bombay grads with a total work experience of 10+ years in fintech and we are backed by global VC investors including Y Combinator.",
