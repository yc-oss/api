  "long_description": "Eze is a B2B Marketplace that connects telecommunication and global electronic wholesalers allowing them to trade devices in wholesale quantities with real-time market data. Our aim is to formalize the fragmented and inefficient second-hand electronics market that had an estimated beachhead of $17 billion in 2016 which grew 50% from 2015. (Deloitte)\r\n\r\nBuyers and sellers use our platform to submit buy and sell requests. Eze automatically connects the two parties with compatible bids and executes the trade. The platform gives businesses real-time market prices and eliminates transaction risk by acting as an intermediary with a secure payment system.",
