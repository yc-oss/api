  "long_description": "At Zumo Labs, we generate synthetic training data for computer vision models.\r\n\r\nComputer vision is the essential technology that powers the products of the future: autonomous vehicles, smart retail, robotics, smart fitness, security and vision-based analytics. These algorithms require huge amounts of training data. This data is currently collected and labeled manually; a slow, imprecise, expensive process that is rife with bias and privacy issues. \r\n\r\nZumo Labs solves all of these problems (and more!) by creating feature rich synthetic training data in the cloud: cheaper, faster to generate and iterate on, covers all the edge cases, and has no bias or privacy issues. \r\n",
