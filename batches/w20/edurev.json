We want to make the process of education and learning so good that you (and your kids) donâ€™t feel the need to go to a school/college/coaching. EduRev stands for Education Revolution and we are looking to achieve nothing less. \r\n\r\nEduRev has over 7 million students and adds around 10 new users each minute. We are backed by the iconic American VC Y Combinator, Artiman Ventures and even angel investors like Anand Chandrashekaran, Austen Allred, Martin Basiri to name a few. \r\n\r\nWe won the Best App award (for learning) by Google, mBillionth award by Bill and Melinda Gates, and even won Startup of the Year by TieCon.\r\n\r\nAndroid App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.edurev\r\nWebsite: http://edurev.in/\r\niOS App (beta): https://apps.apple.com/in/app/edurev/id1529835494",
