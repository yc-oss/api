  "long_description": "Big companies are drowning in Jira tickets. They get thousands of reported issues—most never read by anyone who understands the whole system. De-duping is a chore. Related issues get filed twenty times under different teams. The result: teams spend hundreds of hours just figuring out what the most important items are, before they can even start fixing them.\r\n\r\nJanet AI is the AI-native ticket triage and management layer for Jira.\r\n\r\nJanet AI watches every incoming ticket and immediately compares it to everything that’s come before. It builds a knowledge graph: which tickets look like the same underlying bug, which roll up into the same component failure, which issues share the same root cause. With this, it auto-displays all relationships, auto‑categorizes issues, and surfaces those that matter most.\r\n\r\nBecause the data’s structured, useful questions become instantly answerable. \"What are the highest priority login bugs hitting enterprise customers running version X?\" \"What fixes would unblock the most ARR right now?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral multi‑billion‑dollar enterprises are already in talks with Janet AI to reduce the manual work involved in managing tickets at scale.",
