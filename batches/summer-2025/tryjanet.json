  "long_description": "Janet AI (tryjanet.ai) is the first AI-native ticket management system, built for modern engineering teams and tool stacks. Janet doesn’t wait for your manual work.\r\n\r\n- Ideas, bug reports, and feature requests get tracked directly from meetings/Slack/Discord/SMS.\r\n- Duplicate or related issues are automatically detected to reduce noise as you scale.\r\n- Tickets are auto-moved when PRs resolving them are opened and merged.\r\n- You can reply to issue reporters in Slack/Discord directly from Janet when a ticket is resolved.\r\n- We bring all your tickets to your Cursor/Claude Code's context so coding agents can fully understand, cluster, prioritize, and resolve issues - the time spent on thorough ticketing finally has tangible ROI.\r\n- And more!\r\n\r\nFounders, product leaders, customer success, and engineers all love Janet: cross-team communication, collaboration, and execution are made seamless. That’s why users repeatedly switch away from Linear, Jira, and others after trying Janet for just a single feature, project, or sprint.\r\n\r\nSounds interesting? Check out tryjanet.ai to get started today!",
