  "long_description": "Janet AI is the intelligent ticket management system.\r\n\r\nAs organizations scale, Jira turns into chaos. Related issues are filed under different teams. De-duping is tedious. Critical insights get lost in comment threads. Tickets are never seen by anyone with full context. As a result, teams spend hundreds of manual hours just figuring out what’s important—before they can even start fixing it.\r\n\r\nJanet AI automatically creates, tracks, and resolves work items through integrations with information channels like Slack, meetings, customer cases, GitHub, and more. Further, Janet AI watches every incoming ticket to build a knowledge graph and automatically surfaces related tickets, streamlines routing, flags prior fixes, and identifies what matters most—across all projects and teams.",
