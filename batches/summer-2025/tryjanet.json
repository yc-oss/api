  "long_description": "Big companies are drowning in Jira tickets. They get thousands of reported issues every month—most never seen by anyone with full context. Related issues are filed under different teams. De-duping is tedious. Critical insights get lost in comment threads. Teams spend hundreds of hours just figuring out what’s important—before they can even start fixing it.\r\n\r\nJanet AI is the AI-native ticket triage and management layer for Jira.\r\n\r\nJanet AI watches every incoming ticket and compares it to everything that’s come before. It builds a knowledge graph across projects: which tickets are duplicates, which share the same root cause, and which roll up into the same component failure. It automatically surfaces related tickets, flags prior fixes, and identifies what matters most—across all projects and teams.\r\n\r\nThis transforms how organizations handle tickets at scale:\r\n• Customer support can immediately check if engineering is already working on a reported issue, reducing back-and-forth and surfacing statuses and fixes faster.\r\n• Ticket routing becomes smarter—Janet shows which individuals or teams are already tackling related issues.\r\n• Engineering teams get cross-project visibility—seeing how other teams are solving similar problems and avoiding redundant work.\r\n• No more context lost in silos—when 20 related tickets each contain a piece of the puzzle, Janet AI connects the dots. You can ask Janet to explore related issues and extract the insights you’d otherwise miss.\r\n\r\nSeveral multi‑billion‑dollar enterprises are already in talks with Janet AI to reduce the manual work involved in managing tickets at scale.\r\n\r\nInterested?
