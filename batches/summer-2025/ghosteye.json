  "long_description": "Organizations have tons of tools protecting your systems, but GhostEye is the tool that protects your humans.\r\n\r\nGhostEye continuously tests employees across all vectors to measure susceptibility to social engineering vulnerabilities before real attackers do. Unlike traditional security training that measures completion rates, GhostEye measures actual resilience through AI-powered attack simulations.\r\n\r\nOur platform replaces quarterly red team assessments with 24/7 human risk monitoring, identifying exactly who's vulnerable to what type of attack so organizations can secure their human attack surface in real-time.",
