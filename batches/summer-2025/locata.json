  "long_description": "Locata is an AI referral management platform for Health Centers. We deploy AI agents to automate every step of the referral process that back-office staff face daily, from submitting authorizations to broadcasting updates and following up with patients. This frees up staff to focus on patient care.\r\n\r\nPrimary Care back-offices are severely understaffed and overburdened by administrative work associated with referrals. Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in CS. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in CS, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google, developing AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and are implementing our system to automate their entire referral workflow.",
