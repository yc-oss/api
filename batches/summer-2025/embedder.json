  "long_description": "Embedder is building the Cursor for embedded software engineers.\r\n\r\nEvery day, embedded engineers deal with fragmented workflows, archaic developer tooling and complex technical documentation. Our mission is to eliminate these roadblocks and allow engineers to focus on what matters most: speed and innovation.\r\n\r\nOur software currently allows you to upload datasheets, chat with agents and generate production-ready driver code in seconds. Near term, we will be giving agents direct access to your hardware, allowing them to flash, test, and debug in real-time. ",
