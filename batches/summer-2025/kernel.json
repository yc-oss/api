  "long_description": "Kernel is the best place in the world to launch web agents and browser automations. We handle the hard parts of running browser infrastructure in the cloud so you don’t have to: spinning up browsers quickly, responsive read/write live view, logs, headless vs. headful mode, replays, residential proxies, and more. Our API allows developers to instantly launch browsers in the cloud, so you can focus on your core product logic rather than the infra underneath.\r\n\r\nOur customers use Kernel to launch QA agents, vertical-specific agents that automate back office processes, and more.\r\n\r\nWe're open source, HIPAA-compliant (SOC2 Type 2 pending), & compatible with every browser/web agent framework (Playwright, Puppeteer, CUA, Browser Use, Magnitude, etc).
