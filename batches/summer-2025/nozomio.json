  "long_description": "Nozomio is a product lab building engineers for the age of AI.\r\n\r\nAs coding agents become ubiquitous, the real bottleneck shifts from “write code” to “know which code and docs to feed them.” Starting with the tool named Nia, the mission is to provide context enrichment through agentic research and indexing of any external codebase(-s) or documentation via MCP / API.\r\n\r\nNozomio started with Arlan's early frustration with the agentic coding ecosystem, especially around context and memory. After winning Product of the Day in February and raising pre-seed, Arlan moved to London and then to SF as a solo immigrant from Kazakhstan to build the future of software engineering. \r\n\r\ntry nia at trynia .ai <3 ",
