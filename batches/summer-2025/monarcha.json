  "long_description": "Monarcha is an AI-powered geospatial platform built for logistics, real estate, urban planning, and environmental teams. It turns natural language into powerful spatial analysis, styling, and workflows with no GIS expertise required.\r\n\r\nWorking with geospatial data today is slow, fragmented, and deeply technical. Simple tasks often require desktop based software and coding expertise. Most platforms rely on outdated desktop software, steep learning curves, and disconnected tools. Even simple tasks like uploading data, running a buffer, or visualizing zones can take hours and require specialists.\r\n\r\nMonarcha changes that.\r\nWe connect directly to your data, enrich it with public datasets, understand spatial context, and let you run 50+ spatial tools instantly on the map. Upload vector or raster files, run PostGIS SQL queries, generate heatmaps, clip zones, and more all with a simple prompt. We're giving everyone the power of advanced spacial analysis to help save time, money and unlock siloed geospatial data across entire organizations. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more?
