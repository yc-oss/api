  "long_description": "Knowledge workers spend 85% of their day in the browser.\r\n\r\nYet so much of this work is tedious, time-consuming labor.\r\n\r\nAI has revolutionized browser automation - but it's trapped behind APIs, SDKs, and complex interfaces. Tools like UIPath and Zapier tried to help, but they're still too technical, expensive, or complicated.\r\n\r\nWhat if automating your repetitive browser work was as easy as explaining it to a coworker?\r\n\r\nThat’s Magnitude. Simply record yourself taking actions on your browser, talk through the details, and our AI builds your automation. Run it instantly or schedule it - no maintenance required.",
