  "long_description": "Eden allows e-commerce brands to use customer data effectively when running campaigns. We help marketing teams understand their customers' stories by using data from their store, sales, support tickets, and marketing channels to turn hesitant browsers into customers who buy.\r\n\r\nAlex and Jason met at TJHSST where they became nationally ranked debate partners and eventually coworkers at Datadog. Alex led operations at Phia, scaling to 100+ brand affiliate partners. Jason led retargeting ads at Reddit and previously sold an AI recruiting startup.\r\n\r\nExisting marketing data sits in silos, underutilized. AI enables marketers to unlock a treasure trove of data to create more effective campaigns in a fraction of the time. We will make every marketing department data-driven.",
