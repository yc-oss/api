  "long_description": "Louiza Labs accurately simulates human biology so medical technology (devices, robots, etc) can be trained and tested without real patients or hard to access real-world medical data.\r\n\r\nOur physics-driven AI engine creates hyper-accurate, multi-organ human models with unprecedented speed and fidelity.\r\n\r\nInstead of spending millions on data for clinical trials, cadaver labs, or risky human testing—use Louiza to:\r\n1. Test devices on digital twins—faster FDA, no animal trials.\r\n2. Generate rare, high-fidelity edge-case datasets.\r\n3. Train AI for combat, triage, and robotic procedures in extreme conditions.\r\n4. Simulate stressed anatomy (e.g., Bruno Fernandes under fatigue, fighter pilots under G-force).\r\n\r\nBonus: Our anatomically accurate models are indistinguishable from real humans and can be “imaged” (e.g., X-ray, ultrasound) for use in ML pipelines.",
