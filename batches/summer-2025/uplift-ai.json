  "long_description": "We build Voice Models for regional languages (like Urdu, Bengali, Greek etc) and make them available through simple APIs and SDKs. \r\nDevelopers use us to create Voice-first digital experiences (eg. Voice eCommerce, Voice Banking, Voice AI Tutors etc).\r\n\r\nWe gather our own data, develop our own labelling tools, train our own models, and design our own voice infra. This fully integrated approach enables us to offer the best models and the best developer experience for regional languages.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPeople who would previously never use certain digital services (like online ordering), actually use the service when they are given an intuitive Voice based interface.\r\nWe believe that Voice Interfaces will onboard 100s of millions of new users onto digital services; and double the addressable market for technology companies. \r\nUplift AI will provide the best models to create these Voice Interfaces for 60% of the world's population that only speaks their regional language and represents 42 trillion dollars in GDP.\r\n",
