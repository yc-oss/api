  "long_description": "We build speech understanding and speech generation models for regional languages, and make them available through easy to use APIs and SDKs.\r\n\r\n60% of the world *only* speaks their regional language. They generate 42 trillion dollars in GDP.  Yet current Voice Models in these languages suck... After the top 5 languages, the models are so bad you can't make any Voice product on top of them. \r\n\r\nWe are fixing this by creating state-of-the-art models for regional languages -- enabling developers to scale their Voice products to every part of the world with consistent high quality experience.\r\n\r\n1,000s of developers already use our APIs; including companies like Khan Academy.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nOur team has previously created Voice technology used by millions daily. We worked on Alexa and Siri; and have launched entire AWS services like AWS Bedrock Guardrails.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nText-interfaces (apps and websites) haven't worked in emerging markets and most work has remained offline. This is causing economies billions of dollars in lost worker efficiency.\r\nPeople don't adopt text-interfaces for two reasons: 1) a billion people can't read any language. 2) typing is really hard/slow on phones -- which is the only device many people have. \r\nVoice AI can fix this, and onboard 100s of millions of new users on to digital services -- for the first time. \r\nThis can increase entire GDPs by making the workforce more efficient.\r\n\r\nHow we are different:\r\nWe have developed unique data gathering and labeling methods to solve for small languages. \r\nWe own our technology stack end-to-end. We gather our own data, then train and deploy our own models. This enables us to optimize the entire stack continuously and hence move faster...\r\nWe already have SOTA models in multiple languages (like Balochi, Sindhi).",
