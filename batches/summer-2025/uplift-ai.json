  "long_description": "We build speech understanding and speech generation models for the five major languages spoken in Pakistan, where 42% of the adult population can not read any language. \r\n\r\nPakistan is the 5th most populous country in the world with a $411 billion GDP. Yet its overlooked and no practical voice models exist for the local languages.\r\n\r\nWith our APIs and SDKs, businesses offer high-quality voice interfaces in domains like banking, agriculture, healthcare, and government services. This enables them to finally offer digital services to every customer -- often for the first time.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has a decade of experience building world-leading voice products, including at Alexa and Siri. We have launched entire AWS services; and software written by us previously is used by millions daily.\r\n\r\nWe do in-house research and development. We gather our own data, then train and deploy our own models. We own our technology stack end-to-end.\r\n\r\nWe are on a mission to uplift entire nations through better access to digital information and digital services.",
