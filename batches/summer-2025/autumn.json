  "long_description": "Autumn is open-source infrastructure over Stripe that allows AI startups to build their pricing plans quickly, and flexibly. We act as your app's DB and manage who's paying for what, track usage and manage customer feature access.\r\n\r\nYC companies use us because we make it easy to handle common pricing models like usage-based, credits, subscriptions, rollovers and more in 3 functions and no webhooks. \r\n\r\nAs you scale, you get reliable billing, that you can change however you want without wrangling code (we handle versioning, migrations etc), and manage custom pricing too. Everything you could down the line (credits, multiple subscription groups, rollovers, referral program, usage analytics, centralized team billing etc), you can drop in at any point. ",
