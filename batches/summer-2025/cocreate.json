  "long_description": "Before editing begins, professional video teams spend days copying, organizing, and prepping footage — a process that can eat up 40% of a project’s time and budget. CoCreate runs in the background during backup, delivering fully organized, searchable, and edit-ready projects for Premiere, Avid, Final Cut, or Resolve the moment media is offloaded. The result: faster turnarounds, fewer errors, and more time spent actually editing.",
