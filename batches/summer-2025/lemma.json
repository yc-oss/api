  "long_description": "Lemma is the consumer insights platform that helps businesses answer the question: What do people think of our brand and products?\r\n\r\nOur team of Stanford grads previously led the viewer satisfaction data insights platform at YouTube and performed AI research at Harvard Medical School and Stanford School of Medicine. We’re working with Disney and other consumer brands to capture customer sentiment on everything from your favorite TV character’s death to the action figurine at the Disneyland gift shop.\r\n\r\nWe are the only all-in-one consumer insights platform with specialized agents that can (1) scour the internet to discover and interpret ongoing conversations to see what people are actually saying, (2) automate survey writing and data collection, and (3) author a draft memo or report in minutes, cutting through days of manual work at a time.",
