  "long_description": "We’re building Lemma because we’ve been there.\r\n\r\nWe’ve worked in professional services and lived the pain — buried in work that doesn’t move the needle. Aggregating numbers from back surveys. Hunting for that one number buried in a mountain of files. Pulling quotes from hours of expert calls. Drafting version 10 of the interview guide. Rebuilding the same CDD survey from scratch. Programming those 100 question surveys.\r\n\r\nGeneric AI agents don’t work here. They don’t understand your content, your context, or your workflow.\r\n\r\nLemma builds AI teammates tailored to the way you actually work — built by people who’ve done the work. Our agents plug into your tools, learn your processes, and handle the grunt work behind the scenes — so you can focus on insights, strategy, and moving fast.",
