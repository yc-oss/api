  "long_description": "We provide home service business owners with voice AI to capture every inbound call and turn it into booked jobs.\r\n\r\nMeet Jane, your AI-powered customer service rep. When a customer calls and no one answers, Jane does. She talks naturally with callers, understands their problem, and books the job, whether it’s a leaky pipe, an AC repair, or a new installation.\r\n\r\nHome services are still phone-first, but owners lose thousands each month to missed calls and overwhelmed CSRs. Every truck, website, and yard sign funnels calls in, yet too often they go to voicemail or get dropped. Jane makes sure the real jobs, the ones that pay, never slip through.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting by solving inbound, the single most expensive leak in the business. With Jane, contractors never miss a call, never lose a customer to voicemail, and finally have a CSR that works 24/7 without turnover or breaks.",
