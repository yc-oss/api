We’re backed by YC (S25).\r\n\r\nRetail investors now account for 25% of all U.S. trading volume, nearly double from 2012.

Astor fixes that. \r\n\r\nOur AI agents uncover opportunities, decode emerging trends, and deliver analysis tailored to you. Instead of drowning in noise, investors gain a clear edge, shifting from guesswork to confident decision-making.\r\n",
