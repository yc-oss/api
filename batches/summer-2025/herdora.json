  "long_description": "Herdora is building the inference layer for mission-critical AI workloads. We provide scalable compute, optimized inference engines, intelligent routing and autoscaling, real-time observability, and kernel-level performance optimizations, with strict SLAs and white-glove support. \r\n\r\nHerdora's long-term bet is maximizing intelligence per watt.\r\n\r\nAI is clearly going to be everywhere. The constraint won't be what models can do, but how much intelligence we can afford to run. \r\n\r\nMost companies waste enormous compute running inference inefficiently. They use the wrong models, bad serving stacks, and infrastructure that wasn't built for their actual workload.\r\n\r\nWe focus on serving enterprises that need the best performance and reliability in the world while keeping control and visibility. They bring their model to Herdora, and we serve back an optimized version. Same quality, 2-10x the speed, fraction of the cost, and strict SLOs. ",
