  "long_description": "RowFlow is like if Typeform or SurveyMonkey started as an AI company. We replace clunky web forms with natural conversations that run over text, slack, or wherever your users are. Our platform aims to double your form’s response rates while cutting your internal overhead in half. \r\n\r\nWith RowFlow, you can take any existing form and instantly convert it into an AI-powered conversation. New flows launch in minutes and reach respondents over your preferred channel or embedded chat. We guide the exchange, follow up automatically, and return clean structured data without extra work from your team.\r\n\r\nForms power billions of business interactions yearly. Whether it’s forms for client intake, registrations, compliance, feedback, or surveys, they all follow the same painful pattern: low conversion, messy data, and frustrated users. Teams have long tolerated forms only because there's been no scalable alternative for collecting structured information from people - until now. Our goal is for RowFlow to become the new default way for how organizations collect user data in an AI-first world.",
