  "long_description": "Paloma is a modular quote-to-cash stack that lets you manage pricing, quoting, and billing processes using natural language.\r\n\r\nB2B quoting and billing systems are stuck in the past. Rigid configurations and overly templatized rules slow down businesses, lead to erroneous manual processes , and result in fragmented sources of truths. Paloma lets you define your business rules in natural language, integrate your playbooks into the sales and quoting process, and automate bespoke billing processes for each of your contracts.",
