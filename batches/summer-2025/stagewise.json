  "long_description": "stagewise builds an open-source frontend coding agent for real codebases. We enable backend devs, designers and product managers to build pretty and functional web apps in a simple and visually guided manner - no matter the used tech stack.\r\n\r\nstagewise lives right inside your browser, makes changes in your local codebase and is compatible with all kinds of frameworks and setups - allowing it to be retrofitted into any existing project. Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built.",
