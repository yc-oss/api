  "long_description": "Lark is building an AI native billing platform to serve the needs of fast growing AI companies. Jack and Vijit previously built Stripe’s usage-based billing system which is used by companies like Intercom and Cloudflare.\r\n\r\nAt Stripe, we were involved in conversations with Cursor, Figma and Clay that didn’t end up choosing Stripe as their billing provider because it didn’t meet their needs. These companies want to define complex pricing models like per-seat credit pools which existing solutions don’t handle. At Lark, we are building a flexible billing engine that can support the latest pricing models and enable hassle-free pricing changes.\r\n \r\nWe also want end users to have an awesome billing experience so we’re starting off by building an AI powered customer portal for subscription companies. We are currently live with 4 customers including Midjourney & Character AI.",
