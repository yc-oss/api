  "long_description": "Lark is building AI agents to solve billing issues for subscription companies. Vijit and Jack previously built the usage-based billing product at Stripe. We are working with four customers including Midjourney & Character AI. \r\n\r\nToday, the customer billing experience for subscription companies is broken. Customers must contact support for simple issues like requesting refunds and downgrading plans. This leads to high billing support volume, low customer satisfaction, and churn. Lark builds AI agents that resolve these issues instantly, with deep billing integrations that factor in usage data, account for prorations and credits, and have strong guardrails to ensure safe actions.\r\n\r\nOver time, we will evolve this into a customer-first billing platform with AI automation built in from day one.",
