  "long_description": "Lark is building an AI native billing platform to serve the needs of fast growing AI companies. Jack and Vijit previously built a usage-based billing system for a large billing provider. \r\n\r\nAI Pricing models are evolving fast and existing billing providers haven’t been able to adapt. Large AI companies have had to build their billing systems in-house because they couldn’t model their pricing with existing billing providers.\r\n\r\nLark provides a flexible pricing engine that can support complex pricing models for these AI companies. It also eliminates billing operations overhead and improves the end user billing experience. \r\n\r\nLark is already working with customers like Midjourney to solve their billing issues and improve end user billing experience on top of existing billing providers. They are currently building a billing platform to make billing integrations trivial for AI companies.",
