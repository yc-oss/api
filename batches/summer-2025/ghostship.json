All you need to do is connect your Github and every time you create a PR, Ghostship will figure out where the bugs are before you push to main.\r\n\r\nWe're starting with web apps, but we'll eventually test any piece of software your users would interact with like a mobile app or a desktop app.\r\n\r\nGhostship â€” ship something people want.",
