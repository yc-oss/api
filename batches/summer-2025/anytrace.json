  "long_description": "Anytrace is the first AI agent that automates the end-to-end workflow of a support engineer. Our agent resolves technical support tickets by interacting with customers, investigating root causes, and tracking issues to completion.\r\n\r\nSam (CEO) was previously the co-founder and CEO of a DevOps platform that raisedâ€¯$2M. Taira (CTO) was the youngest SDE 2 at AWS Sagemaker Inference. We have over five years of experience handling technical support for customers ranging from small startups to Fortune 500 companies like Salesforce.\r\n\r\nWe came into YC with just an idea, and we already have our first pilot customer paying $5 per support ticket.\r\n\r\nEssentially every B2B software company devotes engineering time to support, and our goal is to automate this away.",
