  "long_description": "Humoniq is building an AI-native platform for business process outsourcing in the travel industry. Travel companies outsource more than 50% of their customer support operations to low-cost regions around the world, but with our AI-native approach, we deliver a much better customer experience and maintain competitive pricing.\r\n\r\nOur team is uniquely equipped to solve this challenge. We grew a travel management company (TMC), Flightfox (YC S12), to over $20M in annual sales while handling thousands of customer support requests every month. For 13 years we lived the problems that we are now solving with our AI-native BPO for travel.",
