  "long_description": "Orange Slice is a spreadsheet where every column is TypeScript—and AI writes it for you. Describe what you want in chat (\"find the CEO's LinkedIn and get their email\"), and we generate the code, create the columns, and run it across thousands of rows. Our fully-typed SDK has 100+ enrichments built in: LinkedIn, contact info, company data, web scraping, AI research. Columns automatically execute in dependency order. No workflow builders—just describe it or code it.",
