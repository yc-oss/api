  "long_description": "Orange Slice uses AI agents to crawl the internet for temporal signals/firmographic data that help sales teams find high-intent prospects by continuously monitoring the internet for buying signals and firmographic changes.\r\n\r\nOur agents scan millions of data sources - including company websites, news articles, job postings, press releases, and social media - to detect meaningful events such as leadership changes, product launches, funding rounds, hiring trends, and more. These insights are transformed into actionable sales signals that indicate a company’s likelihood to purchase your product.\r\n\r\nWith Orange Slice, revenue teams can prioritize outreach, personalize messaging, and dramatically improve conversion rates by engaging the right accounts at the right time - based on what’s actually happening, not just static firmographics.",
