  "long_description": "The problem we solve: 56% of dealership leads arrive after business hours, and most dealers lose these potential customers to competitors who happen to be available 24/7. Missing after-hours calls alone costs the average dealership $1M annually in lost revenue.\r\n\r\nWe built Flai to fix this - AI assistants that answer dealership calls 24/7, scheduling test drives, oil changes, or running outbound recall campaigns so no opportunity slips away.\r\n\r\nThe result: No more missed opportunities, no more losing customers to competitors.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.\r\n\r\nWe're not just answering phones, we're helping dealerships win in an AI-first world where availability determine who gets the sale.",
