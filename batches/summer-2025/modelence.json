  "long_description": "You built the demo in a weekend. Now you need auth, a prod-grade database, real-time events, AI observability, cron jobs, email, monitoring… and you needed them yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe spent a decade at our previous startup, building a platform while scaling to millions of users and customers like Meta & Netflix. Now we put that into an open-source framework, so others wouldn’t have to do the same from scratch.\r\n\r\nModelence is a batteries-included framework that abstracts away boilerplate so you can just focus on building your product logic and nothing else - it’s like Next.js + Vercel + Supabase on a single platform, built for full-stack TypeScript.\r\n\r\nShipping production apps is much harder than building a prototype that runs locally and 95% of all production apps share the same building blocks. We did a massive amount of work on our previous platforms that was not specific to our product, and we’ve created Modelence to abstract that away:\r\n- Authentication\r\n- Database setup\r\n- Hosting / CDN\r\n- AI integration (LLM observability, prompts)\r\n- Real-time events\r\n- Cron jobs\r\n- Email service\r\n- Monitoring\r\n- Analytics\r\n- Admin dashboards\r\n\r\nAndrej Karpathy recently posted about this same exact problem:\r\nhttps://x.com/karpathy/status/1905051558783418370\r\n\r\nand explained it further in his YC AI Startup School talk:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?feature=shared&t=1940",
