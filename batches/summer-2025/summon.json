  "long_description": "Summon is the complete end-to-end MCP platform. We're building the pipes connecting context to client applications for the agent economy. \r\n\r\nSummon transforms MCP development from a fragmented, manual process into an AI-first, collaborative workflow. We build MCP servers from OpenAPI specs using our AI agent, provide debugging playgrounds, run continuous evaluations against different LLMs, and offer enterprise hosting with observability. This creates a complete virtuous loop where AI builds, maintains, and improves MCP integrations, accelerating time-to-market, reducing bugs, and aligning developers, QA, and product teams.\r\n\r\nWith MCP gaining adoption across ChatGPT, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot, companies need agent-accessible APIs to remain competitive.",
