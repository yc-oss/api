  "long_description": "Founded in June of 2025, Frizzle uses AI to automatically grade math worksheets and assignments. The average teacher spends 10 hours per week grading homework - our software gets it done in minutes.\r\n\r\nFrizzle eliminates the most time-consuming part of teachers’ workflows, and is the most valuable piece of software ever for teachers. Our platform helps educators automate repetitive tasks like grading and feedback, so they can focus on what matters most - teaching. \r\n\r\nTwo principles guide our work. First, build tools teachers actually trust and enjoy using. Second, design products that are simple, fast, and seamlessly fit into the classroom.",
