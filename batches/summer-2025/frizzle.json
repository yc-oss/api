  "long_description": "Frizzle uses AI to grade handwritten math assignments for teachers and transform them into rich analytics and differentiated assessment to help personalize instruction for every student. Teachers spend over 10 hours a week or 25% of all their work grading - Frizzle does it in minutes. Frizzle is the most valuable piece of software for teachers ever, as it eliminates the most time-consuming part of their workflow so they can focus on teaching.\r\n\r\nFrizzle shifts education from waterfall to agile learning. Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",
