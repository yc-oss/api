By automating the manual decisions that consume planning, dispatch, and CSR teams (assigning loads, managing appointments, communicating updates, and resolving exceptions) carriers can increase revenue-per-driver while running leaner teams.\r\n\r\nLeeds and Derek have been building together as close friends for over six years. The team have been early PMs/engineers at exited startups and decacorns and worked on the algorithms behind Amazon’s robotic logistics systems.",
