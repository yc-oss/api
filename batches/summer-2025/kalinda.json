  "long_description": "Kalinda helps class action law firms qualify potential cases in minutes with AI.\r\n\r\nThe nature of class action/mass torts involves thousands of cases for a single lawsuit. For every plaintiff (injured person), law firms involved in these cases compile everything from the products they used to the injuries they have. This data is extensive, granular, and buried deep in thousands of pages of medical, financial, and employment records and others.\r\n\r\nKalinda extracts, summarizes, and aggregates data from these records for attorneys with AI.\r\n\r\nWhen scaled across an entire litigation, Kalinda works tirelessly and in parallel—turning a process that once took months into just a few hours. \r\n\r\nKalinda provides firms with the equivalent manpower of hundreds of paralegals and legal nurses, allowing them to quickly determine which claimants are eligible and helping them file faster and in greater volume.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve processed 600k pages of records and are live with 2 of the largest plaintiff law firms in the U.S!",
