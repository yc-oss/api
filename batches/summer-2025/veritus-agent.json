  "long_description": "Veritus is a platform for deploying AI agents for loan servicing and collections, including inbound and outbound voice agents. Our agents negotiate repayment plans, follow up across channels, and drive recoveries with zero human involvement.\r\n\r\nWe license our platform to lenders and collections agencies, and we're also in the process of getting licensed in all 50 states to enable our own third-party collections and debt buying. By combining cutting edge voice AI with deep regulatory compliance and vertical specialization we're able to drastically reduce the cost-to-collect while increasing recovery rates. ",
