  "long_description": "Shor is a new Employer-of-Record built from the ground up with AI agents and stablecoins. We enable remote teams to hire and pay global employees at a fraction of the cost. The process is fast, simple, and fully compliant.\r\n\r\nToday, global payroll is broken. Payments take days, cost 5â€“10% in fees, and force companies to navigate complex banking, tax, and labor regulations. Platforms like Deel and Rippling solved this for large enterprises but remain too expensive and cumbersome for the millions of startups and growing remote teams scaling globally.\r\n\r\nShor fixes this by combining autonomous AI agents with stablecoin-based settlement. Our agents handle contracts, worker classification, compliance, and payroll automatically in a simple, messaging-first experience. Payments can settle in seconds rather than weeks at a fraction of the cost of legacy providers.\r\n\r\nWe are making global payroll fast, affordable, and accessible for the millions of companies left out by legacy platforms.",
