  "long_description": "We help people understand their agent workflows and where they went wrong.\r\n\r\nWe met early on at MIT and built a bunch of projects together for fun. Of course when the AI wave took over, we were excited about agents. We made our own agents, and we always found it annoying figuring out if they consistently worked or not.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it should be easy to know what your agents are doing and why, no matter the use case or the tech stack. So that's exactly what we're helping companies achieve; we started building a few weeks ago and are working with our design partner to get deep observability and insights into their agent executions.\r\n\r\nThe future is autonomous; AI agents will be everywhere. Mohi can make sure that we humans know what these agents are doing.",
