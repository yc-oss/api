  "long_description": "Ambral is an AI Account Management team.\r\n\r\nAmbral synthesizes signals from all customer activity and interactions into AI-powered models of every account. It pinpoints who needs attention and why, and autonomously drives or recommends expansions, prevents churn, and ensures no customer slips through the cracks. It's like mission control for your customers.\r\n\r\nTeam: \r\nSam (CEO): 2x founder. Led AI at Everlywell and early PM at Wonder (now valued at $7bn). Lived the pain of losing customer intimacy at scale and is obsessed with solving it. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nJack (CTO): Ex-SpaceX Flight Software Special Projects, where he developed telemetry routing and analysis systems for the most complex machines ever created. Heâ€™s now doing the same for the complexities of customer relationships. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nAs B2B companies scale, the founder-level customer intimacy that drives early growth becomes impossible to maintain. Customer context that once fit in a founder's head scatters across systems, logs, and communication channels, drowning teams in noise no human can make sense of. Account managers juggling multiple customers become reactive firefighters, bleeding revenue through missed upsells and preventable churn. We've lived this pain and are building Ambral to help teams scale their most valuable asset: customer obsession.",
