  "long_description": "Ambral is an AI account management team that finds the upsell opportunities and churn-risks hiding in your data.\r\n\r\nWe act as a telemetry system for your customer relationships, synthesizing critical signals from your messy data to generate a dynamic digital model of every customer. Ambral then delivers proactive directives on who needs attention, why, and the exact actions needed to expand an account, prevent churn, or create a new customer champion. \r\n\r\nAs B2B companies scale, the founder-level customer intimacy that drives early growth becomes impossible to maintain. Customer context that once fit in a founder's head scatters across systems, logs, and communication channels, drowning teams in noise no human can make sense of. Account managers juggling multiple customers become reactive firefighters, bleeding revenue through missed upsells and preventable churn. We've lived this pain and are building Ambral to help teams scale their most valuable asset: customer obsession.\r\n\r\nTeam: \r\nSam (CEO): 2x founder. Led AI/ML Product at Everlywell and early PM at Wonder (now valued at $7bn). He lived the pain of losing customer intimacy at scale and is obsessed with solving it. \r\n\r\nJack (CTO): Ex-SpaceX Flight Software Special Projects, where he developed telemetry routing and analysis systems for the most complex machines ever created. Heâ€™s now doing the same for the complexities of customer relationships. ",
