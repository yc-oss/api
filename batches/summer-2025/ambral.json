  "long_description": "Ambral is an AI account management team that finds the upsell opportunities and churn-risks hiding in your data.\r\n\r\nWe analyze telemetry from customer relationships, synthesizing the critical signals from your messy data to generate dynamic AI models of every account. We pinpoint exactly who needs attention and why, then recommend or autonomously take the right action to drive an expansion, prevent churn, and make sure no request falls through the cracks.\r\n\r\nTeam: \r\nSam (CEO): 2x founder. Led AI Product at Everlywell and early PM at Wonder (now valued at $7bn). Lived the pain of losing customer intimacy at scale and is obsessed with solving it. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nJack (CTO): Ex-SpaceX Flight Software Special Projects, where he developed telemetry routing and analysis systems for the most complex machines ever created. Heâ€™s now doing the same for the complexities of customer relationships. Cornell CS alum.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nAs B2B companies scale, the founder-level customer intimacy that drives early growth becomes impossible to maintain. Customer context that once fit in a founder's head scatters across systems, logs, and communication channels, drowning teams in noise no human can make sense of. Account managers juggling multiple customers become reactive firefighters, bleeding revenue through missed upsells and preventable churn. We've lived this pain and are building Ambral to help teams scale their most valuable asset: customer obsession.",
