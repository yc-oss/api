  "long_description": "Blank Bio is building foundation models to power a computational toolkit for RNA therapeutics.\r\n\r\nOur first model is state-of-the-art in mRNA property prediction. It simulates costly experiments, helping partners design more effective mRNA medicines faster and cheaper. Our open-source models are being used by Sanofi & GSK. We’re also collaborating with the Arc Institute to bring our RNA embeddings into the next generation of virtual cell models. \r\n\r\nmRNA design is just the beginning. As the model improves, we’re extending to applications like target ID, novel biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and more. We’ve spent decades applying machine learning to biology across academia (Ph.D.’s at the University of Toronto) and industry (Recursion, Deep Genomics, Amazon). \r\n\r\nContact us to learn more: founders@blank.bio ",
