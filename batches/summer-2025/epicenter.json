  "long_description": "Epicenter is an ecosystem of open-source, local-first apps. We store all your work—notes, transcripts, chat histories—in a single folder of plain text and SQLite. Every tool we build shares this memory: your text editor, personal assistant, etc.. It's open, tweakable, and yours. Grep it, open it in Obsidian, host it wherever you like. The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to build a personal workspace where you own your data, choose your models, and replace siloed apps with open, interoperable alternatives. All while preserving authenticity and being free and open source. ❤️\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter\r\n",
