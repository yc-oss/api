  "long_description": "We're building a suite of open-source, local-first apps that share a single memory—so your ideas, plans, and code live in one connected space. Most tools divide you: one for notes, one for tasks, one for contacts. Epicenter is designed to blur those lines—so you can stay in flow across disciplines.\r\n\r\nWe’ve started with tools like Whispering (a fast, local transcription tool) and epicenter.sh (a way to talk to a folder on your computer).
