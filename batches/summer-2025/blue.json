  "long_description": "Blue is the first voice assistant on iOS and Android that can control every app on your phone, so you can get work done hands-free.\r\n\r\nIt reads and replies to messages and email across apps, attaches photos and files, books and pays, manages calendar items, and more.\r\n\r\nUnlike assistants that stop at answers or timers, Blue taps, types, and swipes inside your existing apps with no app-specific integrations. On iPhone, a tiny USB-C plug-in (“Bud”) provides precise input control so Blue can act on your behalf. (Android support is in testing.)\r\n\r\nBlue is already in real-world use: people are clearing inboxes, paying bills from email, sharing files, and moving through routine flows while their hands are busy.\r\n\r\nThe team brings complementary experience at scale: Omar Abdelaziz led Google Assistant’s transition to LLMs and holds one of earliest patents in LLM-based computer control; Peter Krogh spent decades designing voice-first dialog systems and was most recently a design lead at Google DeepMind building actions for Gemini Live; Muhammad Farhan Hossain helped ship Apple Vision Pro, is named on dozens of hardware/systems patents, and has led products from prototype to mass production.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built systems used by billions. Now we’re on to defining the next era of computing.",
