  "long_description": "Channel3 is building a database of every product on the internet.\r\n\r\nGoogle and OpenAI maintain vast product graphs, but keep that valuable data to themselves. Channel3 gives every developer access, opening a world of possibility for new shopping experiences across any vertical. For instance, developers could build AI fashion stylists or give their agents shopping capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe don’t just collect product data; we actually understand it. With the latest image classification and reasoning models, we can match products across merchants—even when listings and images differ—recognize variants, and surface the perfect matches for every search. As we grow, we’ll capture unique insights into what users want, click, and buy.\r\n\r\nAs AI models get smarter and cheaper, our flywheel accelerates: our catalog will improve, and it will be even easier for developers and vibe-coders to build on our infrastructure. To further incentivize building on Channel3, we provide built-in monetization; developers earn commissions on sales they drive.\r\n\r\nAlex discovered this need while building an AI tutor that could recommend products and earn affiliate revenue. When no solution existed, he persuaded his smartest friend from Duke and former co-founder George to leave Palantir and build Channel3 together.",
