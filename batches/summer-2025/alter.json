  "long_description": "Alter is a zero-trust identity and access control platform purpose-built for AI agents. It wraps every tool call in strong authentication, fine-grained authorization, and real-time guardrails, so agents can move fast without breaking things.\r\n\r\nEach request is verified at the parameter level, authorized against granular policies, executed with least-privilege access, and fully audited in real time. Unsafe actions, whether itâ€™s a rogue DROP TABLE or a payment above policy limits, are blocked before they touch production. Behind the scenes, Alter manages credentials, issuing ephemeral, scope-narrowed access for every interaction, then rotating or expiring it in seconds. The result: no long-lived secrets, no blind spots, and no surprises in audit.\r\n\r\nWith Alter, teams can move fast on AI agent initiatives while staying fully compliant with SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and internal security standards. A CISO-ready dashboard delivers real-time visibility, detailed audit logs, and compliance-ready controls, removing silos, eliminating excessive permissions, and providing complete oversight of every agent workflow.",
