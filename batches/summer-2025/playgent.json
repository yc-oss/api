  "long_description": "When enterprise agents fail in production, the conditions that caused the failure are critical: user state, data, tool calls, and context. Without a way to recreate these conditions, teams can't fix what broke.\r\n\r\nPlaygent provides infrastructure to create high-fidelity sandbox environments for AI agents. Our environments come packaged as a single MCP url where tool calls are mocked, authentication is abstracted away, and test data can be initialized via natural language or JSON specifications.\r\n\r\nTeams can use Playgent to reproduce production failures in safe, scoped environments that accurately reconstruct state. Finally, export runs as OTel traces from Playgent's environment to plug directly into your observability tools or RL pipelines.",
