  "long_description": "Vulcan uses AI to map every law, regulation, and court case in America, allowing government agencies and businesses to replace massive consulting projects with instant automated analyses. We call this \"intelligent legal cartography.\"\r\n\r\nIn 3 months, we went from zero customers to Virginia's Executive Order 51, requiring all state agencies to use Vulcan. We are now live with the U.S. Department of Education, a regulatory reform PAC in South Carolina, and have a pipeline of several additional state and federal agencies and major enterprises.\r\n\r\nOur initial agency partners use legal cartography to draft lawful regulations, respond to public comments on regulations, and instantly generate mandatory cost-benefit analyses.\r\n\r\nWe have both public and private sector visions. In the public sector: we endeavor to automate the entire regulatory process end-to-end; replacing the consulting industrial complex with software. In the private sector: we plan to automate regulatory compliance, tackling the $4 trillion regulatory cost on the U.S. economy.",
