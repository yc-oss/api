  "long_description": "Modern robots perform complex tasks but operate as black boxes. Operators can't understand their decision-making or predict when they may fail. This uncertainty gates widespread adoption across countless industries where errors are unacceptable.\r\n\r\nParametric is training safe robotics models that reveal internal reasoning and offer real-time intervention to unlock deployment across safety-critical industries.
