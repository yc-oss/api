  "long_description": "Cyberdesk is the computer use agent for Windows apps. Top YC startups in healthcare, finance, and more are using our agent to automate data entry and extraction from EHRs, ERPs, and other legacy Windows software. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, our intelligent caching system makes automations run deterministically when in the happy path, and with 95% cheaper cost and ~5x speed improvement over computer use. But our system still falls back to computer use in anomalies / edge cases, for extra reliability and safety.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",
