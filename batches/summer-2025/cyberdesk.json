  "long_description": "Cyberdesk is the first self learning computer use agent for developers to automate desktop workflows. \r\n\r\nFor example, one of our customers is building an AI agent for hospital patient intake, and they’re using us to automate an entire team of people manually clicking and typing into a desktop app to book appointments. \r\n\r\nWe launched mid July, and our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",
