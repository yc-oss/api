  "long_description": "Cyberdesk is the computer use agent for developers to automate legacy Windows apps. Our agent clicks and types on any Windows desktop like a human, replacing the need for developers to hire unreliable remote workers or to build brittle automation scripts. \r\n\r\nWe launched a month ago and we’ve closed 80k ARR. Our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.\r\n\r\nOur unique insight is in our agent’s intelligent caching, which allows it to be as fast and cheap as traditional automation scripts while self healing from unexpected situations in the screen. \r\n\r\nMahmoud previously scaled RPA to 20K employees at a Fortune 100 company, and Alan is ex-NASA and has been building with computer use models since their earliest releases.\r\n\r\nTraditional robotic process automation is a $6 billion industry, yet it only services a tiny fraction of desktop tasks that can now be automated by our agent. In the long term, our agent will automate every manual computer task.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",
