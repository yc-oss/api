  "long_description": "Fleetline is building the first complete-context algorithmic load planner for mid to large-sized trucking fleets. Today’s dispatchers face an overwhelming task: balancing regulations, customer demands, live fleet data, and individual driver needs, all while coordinating across siloed tools and teams. Mistakes run rampant, and each mistake is thousands of dollars. Even the select fleets using algorithms that have fleet-wide context struggle: the outputs are rigid, hard to interpret, and are blind to real-world nuances like driver preferences and schedule exceptions. Fleetline solves this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can easily adapt algorithms to each fleet’s needs and capture driver-specific information. The result is smarter planning truly optimized for every fleet and its drivers.",
