All you have to do is text us what you're selling, and we'll take care of the rest -- researching the product, listing on marketplaces, negotiating with buyers, answering questions, and handling delivery. \r\n\r\nWe all have that thing we've been too lazy to sell. Rid makes it so easy we can't even be lazy. ",
