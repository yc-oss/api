  "long_description": "Juxta is creating the first Universal Positioning System (UPS) — a GPS alternative that can monitor movement anywhere on earth with no new hardware, minimal internet connection, and remote deployment. Using custom machine learning models and a first-of-its-kind synthetic fingerprinting technology, Juxta can make any indoor, outdoor, or underground space location-aware in minutes for a fraction of the cost of any other geospatial technology.\r\n\r\nJuxta's UPS can be leveraged across industries — from securely tracking soldiers in combat zones to providing offline positioning for robots to offering asset tracking in warehouses and ports around the globe.",
