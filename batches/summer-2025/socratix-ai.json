  "long_description": "Socratix builds AI coworkers for fraud and risk teams so that humans don't have to spend their days drowning in alerts and spreadsheets.\r\n\r\nToday, fraud and risk teams at fintechs and banks are overwhelmed. Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution. ",
