  "long_description": "Pharmie is an AI assistant for pharmacies. It can pick up calls, process prescriptions, handle insurance follow-ups, and even help upsell specific drugs and services. Pharmacies can get 50+ phone calls a day, and missing phone calls means lost revenue from filling prescriptions.\r\n\r\nPharmacy workflows are complex and custom to each pharmacy's needs. Generic tools are not enough, which is why AI agents can handle tasks end-to-end that previously could not be automated. We are constantly evolving Pharmie to become a suite of agents that supercharge your pharmacy.\r\n\r\nIn the future, pharmacies will evolve into patient care centers, bridging the gaps in access caused by todayâ€™s overburdened healthcare system. Successful pharmacies will use AI to optimize their operations, resulting in a higher quality patient experience traditional pharmacies cannot match.",
