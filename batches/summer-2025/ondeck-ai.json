  "long_description": "We let organizations instantly find any object, behavior or event, in any footage, without needing to train a model or collect any training data.\r\n\r\nThe Pain: Creating vision models usually takes months: collecting training data, training, then deployment.  Worse yet: \r\n+ it’s often impossible to get enough data for a specific task, and \r\n+ even the best cv models struggle to generalize across diverse camera setups, workflows and environments. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these blockers, we bet early on the power of VLMs and built a vision engine that can generalize across any task and doesn’t need any training data. We published a NeurIPS workshop paper showing our new methods with VLMs beat traditional CV even at niche tasks.\r\n\r\nOur current customers include:\r\n- National Defense Organizations\r\n- Robotics Research\r\n- Security cameras\r\n- Behaviour analysis for port monitoring\r\n- Off-shore oil & gas monitoring",
