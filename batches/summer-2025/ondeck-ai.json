  "long_description": "OnDeck is the infrastructure layer that makes Vision Language Models accessible and scalable for enterprise. We let organizations instantly find any object, behavior or event, in any footage, without needing to train a model or collect any training data.\r\n\r\nThe Pain: Creating vision models usually takes months: collecting training data, training, then deployment.  Worse yet: \r\n+ it’s often impossible to get enough data for a specific task, and \r\n+ even the best cv models struggle to generalize across diverse camera setups, workflows and environments. \r\n\r\nTo overcome these blockers, we bet early on the power of VLMs and built a vision engine that can generalize across any task and doesn’t need any training data. We published a NeurIPS workshop paper showing our new methods with VLMs beat traditional CV even at niche tasks.\r\n\r\nOur current customers include:\r\n- National Defense Organizations\r\n- Robotics Research\r\n- Security cameras\r\n- Behaviour analysis for port monitoring\r\n- Off-shore oil & gas monitoring",
