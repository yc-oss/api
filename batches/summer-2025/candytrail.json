  "long_description": "We’re building conversation intelligence for in-person sales teams. Our platform records every customer interaction and then answers and coaches reps in real time — surfacing the talk tracks that actually close, flagging common objections as they come up, and delivering instant tips that drive revenue while the conversation is still happening. Think of it as Gong or Granola for offline sales, but built to guide reps live instead of after the fact. Today, we are deployed across industrial automation, pharmaceuticals, real estate brokerages, and retail.\r\n",
