  "long_description": "GETASAP is a tech-enabled, data driven, fresh-produce supply service for restaurants, small grocers, dark stores, and regional retailers in the US and Southeast Asia. We gather demand data from retailers of any size and watch what each location actually sells, keep one to three days of the right items (mainly fresh and confectionery right now) in nearby micro-fulfillment centers, and deliver within 8 hours.\r\n\r\nThe core of our business is our demand intelligence software that processes demand data we receive from every store. We own the inventory, maintain cold-chain and lot traceability, and handle substitutions. The result is simple: higher in-stock on your top items, less waste, predictable pricing on staples, and fewer emergencies. We help many businesses eliminate overstocks and out of stocks completely and help them gain visibility to their inventory through demand intelligence software.",
