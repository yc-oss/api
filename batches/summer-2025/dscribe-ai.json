  "long_description": "dScribe AI uses autonomous drones and 3D vision to track bulk inventory. We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.\r\n\r\nBulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 30 to 50%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
