  "long_description": "Snapjoy is an online photo storage service that imports photos from anywhere and organizes them in a meaningful way.\n\nAfter uploading some photos, the app categorizes the photos for its user, using metadata to try to intelligently place the correct photos in each album. If the user uploads the same photo multiple times, Snapjoy ignores the duplicates.\n\nBy default, everything uploaded to Snapjoy is private but users can still share photos with specific groups of friends, and if the users grant permission, friends can actually copy usersâ€™ photos into their own Snapjoy album.\n\nSnapjoy was launched in 2011 and is headquartered in Boulder, C.O.",
