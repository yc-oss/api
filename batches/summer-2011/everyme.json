With Everyme, you can share like you do in real life, in intimate Circles.\r\n\r\nA Circle is a private news feed between you and a group of people. It’s private and secure, so you no longer need to worry about who sees what. And because a Circle is created from your address book, you don’t need to convince everyone to sign up for yet another service in order to receive your stories, it just works.",
