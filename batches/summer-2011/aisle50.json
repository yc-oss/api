  "long_description": "Aisle50 came out of the summer 2011 class at Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley accelerator.  Aisle50 builds CPG and retailer campaigns aimed to get both banner and brand incremental shoppers, bigger share and valuable brand messaging to consumers.\n\nOur product has a two-year track record of producing baskets that are 30% larger for our retailers.  We also give our retailer partners incremental trips that, in the past, they would have lost to competitors.  Aisle50 content, because much of it is in the form of offers that are paid for through Web or Mobile, compel the consumer to head to the store sooner rather than later.  \n\nEverybody wins: We drive trips to stores, new customers to CPGs and big discounts to consumers.",
