Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost.\r\n\r\nSince June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.\r\n\r\nAfter power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets.

    "long_description": "In emerging markets like the Philippines, open finance is still nascent. Most of the population is traditionally unbanked, banking APIs don’t exist, and a borrower’s financial history lives in documents: e-wallet records, bank statements, utility bills, and more. Because this data is unstructured, credit and risk teams are forced into manual review. This slows decisioning, increases costs, and caps lending volume. Legacy OCR solutions break on noisy, real-world files and still require human verification.\r\n\r\nKita is the first document intelligence platform built specifically for lending. We are hyperlocalized around the signals that actually drive lending outcomes in emerging and undertapped domestic markets like the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and beyond. Using a layered system led by vision-language models and computer vision, we outperform traditional OCR by transforming messy borrower documents into fraud-checked, decision-ready signals lenders can use directly in underwriting.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Kita is a learning system. We link document-level signals to repayment outcomes, allowing our models to continuously improve fraud detection and risk assessment over time. This creates a compounding advantage for lenders as their distinct underwriting decisions feed back into the system.\r\n\r\nWe secured a six-figure paid pilot with a Philippine lender the week we built our prototype. Since then, we’ve expanded with customers across multiple Southeast Asian markets, shipped new features continuously, and grown roughly 30% MoM.\r\n\r\nWe’re Carmel and Rhea. We met before Stanford and have been building together ever since. Carmel is from Manila, is a repeat founder, and spent three years in product at Apple. Rhea has a research background in computer vision and received the highest honor in Stanford Computer Science. Together, we combine deep local context with strong technical execution to build the infrastructure that expands access to credit in emerging markets.",

We cut inspection time from about 5 minutes to under 30 seconds per fish, with more than 90 percent accuracy, so farms advance only high quality fish and waste less feed and labor. Our goal is to bring automation across the entire fish production lifecycle for the $300B aquaculture industry.\r\n\r\nAquaculture is the fastest growing food sector, and has already surpassed commercial fishing for production of seafood. Yet two of the most critical QA and QC steps in fish production are still done by hand: phenotyping and deformity inspection. These processes are slow, error prone, and despised by technicians but vital for the success of the farm, so much so that farms spend >$200K a year on trained technicians and geneticists to operate. We’ve built an AI vision platform for vertically integrated finfish farms that drops into existing workflows starting in the hatchery, uses off the shelf cameras, standardizes these QA steps, and creates a proprietary multi species dataset that becomes the brain for future autonomous aquafarms. Phenotyping is the start, but the platform is designed to be a drop in solution that can easily expand into feeding, health monitoring, and processing so we can solve production problems across the lifecycle.\r\n\r\n We signed a 6-figure paid pilot with the largest trout producer in the United States, are deploying into 2 more farms early 2026, and trained models above 90 percent accuracy while cutting inspection time from 5 minutes to under 30 seconds. Each deployment adds labeled images to our dataset and improves cross species generalization.\r\n",

Most startups do one; incumbents can’t rebuild their stack without breaking everything.\r\n\r\nSaksham and Ishan met in school and have known each other since 15 years. Saksham was Co-founder/CTO of Iterate AI (backed by EF) and posts content on social media; Ishan has spent ~5yr building memory-heavy, performance-critical browser apps at HackerRank (S11) and deeply understands browsers. He has built Hotspoter (5M+ downloads) when he was 14.\r\n\r\nTogether, we’re unusually suited to build the editor core others avoid.\r\n\r\nVideo is becoming the default distribution channel, and the team that iterates fastest compounds attention.
