    "long_description": "Sarah AI is building the AI-native operating system for consumer goods brands—an autonomous supply-chain brain that replaces legacy ERPs and actually runs the business. Founded by Chris (2x Founder; ex-CEO at Better Nature; Forbes 30U30) and Dirk (ex-Google Data, Analytics & AI Lead), we’re backed by YC (W26).\r\n\r\nIn our first month full-time, we’ve raised $1.6M and secured rapid commercial traction with 15 design partners and a growing pipeline of 30+ brands. Our mission is bold: give CPG brands completely hands-free supply chains that run themselves through Sarah, their AI ops assistant.\r\n\r\nWe’re now growing a small, world-class team of builders excited to reinvent how physical goods companies operate—end-to-end, autonomous, and AI-first. If you want to work on hard problems, ship fast, and define the future of autonomous operations, you’ll feel right at home here.\r\n",

    "long_description": "As autonomy moves into complex safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation), failures become more costly and companies must devote significant in-house effort to validate their system before real-world deployment. Valgo accelerates autonomous systems development and certification by providing tooling to perform algorithmic safety validation at scale. We are building a platform to efficiently find rare and realistic failure events in simulation at a fraction of the compute cost required by existing approaches. Our tools are agnostic to models/simulators (i.e., black box) and can be applied across industries such as autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance.\r\n\r\nValgo is founded by Stanford PhDs who wrote the textbook and taught the course at Stanford on algorithmic safety validation. We also have significant industry experience working on an FAA-certified collision avoidance system at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, validating autonomous aircraft at Xwing, and collaborating with industry sponsors across transportation, aviation, and energy.",

Photos, voice notes, text updates, and observations are instantly transformed into searchable insights for reps, managers, and leadership. AVoice highlights risks, opportunities, buying signals, product issues, market trends, and territory health in real time.\r\n\r\nBy turning the offline economy into usable data, AVoice gives companies the visibility they’ve always had for digital sales — now applied to the real world where deals are actually won.",
