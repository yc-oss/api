Drone inspections identify maintenance concerns before they cause faults. Faults cause power outages, and spark wildfires - like the Eaton Fire in early 2025 where 19 people lost their lives and nearly 10,000 structures were destroyed. Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost.\r\n\r\nSince June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.\r\n\r\nAfter power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate and other inspection markets.

We cut inspection time from about 5 minutes to under 30 seconds per fish, with more than 90 percent accuracy, so farms advance only high quality fish and waste less feed and labor. Our goal is to bring automation across the entire fish production lifecycle for the $300B aquaculture industry.\r\n\r\nAquaculture is the fastest growing food sector, and has already surpassed commercial fishing for production of seafood. Yet two of the most critical QA and QC steps in fish production are still done by hand: phenotyping and deformity inspection. These processes are slow, error prone, and despised by technicians but vital for the success of the farm, so much so that farms spend >$200K a year on trained technicians and geneticists to operate. We’ve built an AI vision platform for vertically integrated finfish farms that drops into existing workflows starting in the hatchery, uses off the shelf cameras, standardizes these QA steps, and creates a proprietary multi species dataset that becomes the brain for future autonomous aquafarms. Phenotyping is the start, but the platform is designed to be a drop in solution that can easily expand into feeding, health monitoring, and processing so we can solve production problems across the lifecycle.\r\n\r\n We signed a 6-figure paid pilot with the largest trout producer in the United States, are deploying into 2 more farms early 2026, and trained models above 90 percent accuracy while cutting inspection time from 5 minutes to under 30 seconds. Each deployment adds labeled images to our dataset and improves cross species generalization.\r\n",

    "long_description": "Chasi helps equipment dealers grow and retain customers with 24/7 VIP treatment across all channels. Chasi’s AI agents act as executive assistants for sales and support reps, automating follow-ups, data collection, status updates, and outreach so teams can spend more time with customers and less on admin.\r\n\r\nOver half of dealer payroll goes to sales and support, but a third of that team’s time is lost to admin. Fleets still run under 60% utilization, most branches lack after-hours coverage, and the aftermarket is largely reactive. Chasi plugs these revenue leaks by keeping units rented or sold, chasing every lead, and driving the right parts and service before machines fail.",
