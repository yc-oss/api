We are building a platform to efficiently find rare and realistic failure events in simulation at a fraction of the compute cost required by existing approaches. Our tools are agnostic to models/simulators (i.e., black box) and can be applied across industries such as autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance.\r\n\r\nValgo was founded by Stanford PhDs who wrote the textbook and taught the course at Stanford on algorithmic safety validation. We also have significant industry experience working on an FAA-certified collision avoidance system at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, validating autonomous aircraft at Xwing, and collaborating with industry sponsors across transportation, aviation, and energy.",

Our agents let IT and RevOps teams configure Salesforce in plain English, accelerating Salesforce delivery by 10× without adding headcount.\r\n\r\nOur agents can:\r\n\r\n> Document your Salesforce org\r\n> Find root causes of support issues\r\n> Perform analysis and dependency mapping\r\n> Configure flows and automations\r\n> Write Apex code and test classes\r\n> Upgrade orgs from legacy versions\r\n\r\nBefore building Ressl, Arushi and Abhishek ran an IT consulting firm for six months, using those learnings to productise RevOps and Salesforce consulting.\r\n\r\nThe global IT outsourcing market is projected to reach ~$600B in 2025. Ressl AI is excited to define what an agentic Accenture looks like.",
