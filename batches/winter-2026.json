Today, businesses wait weeks for coverage because the $1 trillion industry runs on a \"human API\"—armies of brokers manually bridging the gap with carriers. Instead of chasing email threads and re-keying data, Panta’s clients get results 10x faster because our AI agents automate the entire back-office.\r\n\r\nVincent was a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, where he led research on foundation models for recommendation at Vertex AI. Frank was a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Apple and is a top open-source contributor to the Rust and Gleam ecosystems.\r\n\r\nWe realized that while carrier response times are slow, the real bottleneck is the broker. Traditional firms spend 80% of their time on manual data entry, forcing them to scale linearly with headcount. By replacing this work with autonomous agents, we operate with zero data entry and significantly higher margins. We are building a service business with software economics.\r\n\r\nWe formed the company in December and have already bound multiple commercial policies for clients in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe aren't just building a better brokerage; we are building the autonomous infrastructure that American business runs on.",

    "long_description": "In emerging markets like the Philippines, open finance is still nascent. Most of the population is traditionally unbanked, banking APIs don’t exist, and a borrower’s financial history lives in documents: e-wallet records, bank statements, utility bills, and more. Because this data is unstructured, credit and risk teams are forced into manual review. This slows decisioning, increases costs, and caps lending volume. Legacy OCR solutions break on noisy, real-world files and still require human verification.\r\n\r\nKita is the first document intelligence platform built specifically for lending. We are hyperlocalized around the signals that actually drive lending outcomes in emerging and undertapped domestic markets like the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and beyond. Using a layered system led by vision-language models and computer vision, we outperform traditional OCR by transforming messy borrower documents into fraud-checked, decision-ready signals lenders can use directly in underwriting.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Kita is a learning system. We link document-level signals to repayment outcomes, allowing our models to continuously improve fraud detection and risk assessment over time. This creates a compounding advantage for lenders as their distinct underwriting decisions feed back into the system.\r\n\r\nWe secured a six-figure paid pilot with a Philippine lender the week we built our prototype. Since then, we’ve expanded with customers across multiple Southeast Asian markets, shipped new features continuously, and grown roughly 30% MoM.\r\n\r\nWe’re Carmel and Rhea. We met before Stanford and have been building together ever since. Carmel is from Manila, is a repeat founder, and spent three years in product at Apple. Rhea has a research background in computer vision and received the highest honor in Stanford Computer Science. Together, we combine deep local context with strong technical execution to build the infrastructure that expands access to credit in emerging markets.",

It provides suggestions and recommendations for each question, making sure we have thought about everything early on. \r\n• Validations: Once the questions are answered, we consolidate them into a document and run parallel agents to once again find issues, contradictions, or areas of improvement. \r\n• BOM Generation: Our AI splits the scope into a block diagram and generates a Bill of Materials (BOM) for each by parsing diagrams and tables from datasheets, getting price and lead time data from top vendors, and internal vendor communications. \r\n• Versioning & Parallel Agents: You can branch designs and use parallel agents to simulate multiple architectures simultaneously, revealing quantitative tradeoffs in cost, price, and lead times \r\n\r\nWe met during our first week of college and became roommates at Berkeley, and are excited to make physical innovation easier!\r\n",

The Cumulus Prediction system will learn usage patterns to optimize resources available to customer jobs.\r\n\r\nGetting started takes less than 20 lines of config. Fine-tuning becomes as simple as specifying your data and model architecture, while inference deployments automatically optimize for latency and cost. \r\n\r\nCumulus handles all GPU orchestration complexity, allowing teams to save on cost and significantly boost performance in real-time while focusing on what matters: building & serving better models. The result is 50-70% cost savings, faster cold starts, and never spending time managing infrastructure ever again.\r\n",

We cut inspection time from about 5 minutes to under 30 seconds per fish, with more than 90 percent accuracy, so farms advance only high quality fish and waste less feed and labor. Our goal is to bring automation across the entire fish production lifecycle for the $300B aquaculture industry.\r\n\r\nAquaculture is the fastest growing food sector, and has already surpassed commercial fishing for production of seafood. Yet two of the most critical QA and QC steps in fish production are still done by hand: phenotyping and deformity inspection. These processes are slow, error prone, and despised by technicians but vital for the success of the farm, so much so that farms spend >$200K a year on trained technicians and geneticists to operate. We’ve built an AI vision platform for vertically integrated finfish farms that drops into existing workflows starting in the hatchery, uses off the shelf cameras, standardizes these QA steps, and creates a proprietary multi species dataset that becomes the brain for future autonomous aquafarms. Phenotyping is the start, but the platform is designed to be a drop in solution that can easily expand into feeding, health monitoring, and processing so we can solve production problems across the lifecycle.\r\n\r\n We signed a 6-figure paid pilot with the largest trout producer in the United States, are deploying into 2 more farms early 2026, and trained models above 90 percent accuracy while cutting inspection time from 5 minutes to under 30 seconds. Each deployment adds labeled images to our dataset and improves cross species generalization.\r\n",

For the first time, an “AI director” inside a professional editor can be a reality.\r\n\r\nWe have to build two hard things at once: a high-performance editor in the browser and an agentic editor that is reliable for production use cases. Most startups do one; incumbents can’t rebuild their stack without breaking everything.\r\n\r\nSaksham and Ishan met in school and have known each other since 15 years. Saksham was Co-founder/CTO of Iterate AI (backed by EF) and posts content on social media; Ishan has spent ~5yr building memory-heavy, performance-critical browser apps at HackerRank (S11) and deeply understands browsers. He has built Hotspoter (5M+ downloads) when he was 14.\r\n\r\nTogether, we’re unusually suited to build the editor core others avoid.\r\n\r\nVideo is becoming the default distribution channel, and the team that iterates fastest compounds attention. Cardboard becomes the default workspace for video production, the way Canva/Figma became the workspace for design - because it’s collaborative, fast, and does the tedious parts for you.",

We're building the infrastructure to get there.\r\n\r\nCurrent AI agents excel at tasks in controlled settings under human supervision. However, the highest value work unfolds over days or weeks, requires fluency across dozens of tools, and the ability to navigate changing conditions. \r\n\r\nPolymath creates production-grade RL environments where agents tackle realistic tasks over extended time horizons, and success is measured by real outcomes. We work with frontier labs to develop and scale environments that expand the frontier of what agents are capable of.\r\n\r\nWe're starting with software engineering, but plan to extend to other domains with the same level of depth and nuance. We envision a future where reliable, autonomous agents can amplify what people can accomplish alone, enabling humanity to tackle the most difficult problems and accelerate progress.",

Traditionally, medical writers spend 8-12 weeks manually compiling data; our system uses study protocol and statistical outputs to instantly generate these reports with full traceability to the source data.\r\n\r\nClinical development is pharma's biggest bottleneck. Despite rising R&D, trial timelines have increased 33% over the last decade. Accelerating clinical timelines by 20% unlocks hundreds of millions in additional revenue per drug by extending patent life. \r\n\r\nGeneric AI fails in pharma due to a lack of traceability, with only 28% of pilots reaching production - the FDA requires traceability for all claims. Our proprietary engine solves this with word-level traceability, linking every generated sentence to clinical evidence. We deploy 100% on-premise to keep sensitive patient data within the client's infrastructure, making us a trusted AI partner for pharma.\r\n\r\nWe automate the most complex parts of CSRs (clinical narratives and biostatistical analysis). Our high-quality output, validated by senior regulatory writers, costs 1/100th of human writing. We're built by experts from Microsoft, Kearney, and IQVIA - combining deep AI engineering with regulatory expertise to solve the \"last mile\" of drug development—a problem generic AI wrappers can't solve because they don't understand the standards or FDA requirements.",
