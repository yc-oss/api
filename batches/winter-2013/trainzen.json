  "long_description": "Terascore is developing an educational tool for teachers to create, administer, and manage tests entirely online. Scores and results are available immediately and teachers get instant analytics on question quality, difficulty, student performance. Any questions created can be stored in a question bank for reuse.\n\nTerascore aims to move all tests online and in doing so make learning more effective and teachers more efficient. The results are shortening the feedback loop for learning and are better for teachers and students.\n\nTerascore makes creating tests radically easier, as it has a WYSIWYG browser-based test authoring tool. Terascore allows teachers to easily integrate images, links, and videos into tests to make them more fun, engaging, and relevant. The inclusion of mathematic equations is also supported.",
