  "long_description": "Prophecy is quantifying the cognitive factors that determine workplace performance -- from mental aptitude, to personality traits, to decision-making styles and interpersonal dynamics.  Drawing from research across many subfields of neuroscience, we have created a suite of cognitive tests that integrate behavioral measures with sensors for collecting biosignals.  The data we collect is unlike that of any existing personality or aptitude test, and gives us the unique ability to predict a tremendous number of traits, characteristics, and job performance measures.  We help employers find the ideal person for a job, and we help managers optimize and motivate their teams.",
