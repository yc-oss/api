  "long_description": "Growing old is part of life. Losing your independence shouldn't be. We believe in a world where seniors can keep their freedom and still feel safe. That's why we created Amulyte; a remote monitoring and activity tracking system for seniors.\n\nAmulyte is committed to providing the technology needed to help protect seniors from falls so they can continue to age at home. There are 55 million seniors in North America, a number that is only going to grow in the coming years. It is becoming increasingly important that seniors are able to continue living in their own homes as they age. Amulyte helps make that possible by using the latest technology to provide coverage anywhere - no more base station or being restricted to your home.",
