  "long_description": "Asseta is an online marketplace for used capital equipment and parts.  We utilize innovative software to bring buyers and sellers together so you can efficiently and transparently collaborate during equipment transactions.  Our web based platform ensures easy price discovery for interested parties and high touch customer service.\r\n\r\nToday over $100B is spent on used manufacturing equipment offline via brokers and middlemen. This huge but un-sexy market has yet to be transformed by technology. The incumbent firms rely on large sales forces and the fragmentation of the market to charge huge margins.   We believe in a better solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFounded in 2013, Asseta is Y Combinator backed startup based in Newport Beach.  For more information, visit www.asseta.com.\r\n\r\nCheck out our AngelLilst profile here:  https://angel.co/asseta?ref=startup_card",
