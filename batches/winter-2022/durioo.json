  "long_description": "We create and license high quality Islamic cartoons and shows that kids watch on our subscription app.\r\n\r\nWe are the right team to do this because we previously created an Islamic cartoon with more than 3 billion views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nAll parents want their kids to grow up with values and virtues close to them. The same goes for Muslim parents - but the reality is - they are struggling to get high quality Islamic content for their kids.\r\n\r\nWe are addressing an underserved market of 70 million Muslim families with internet access globally.",
