  "long_description": "Myria is a private community and concierge for off-market goods & services — the things you can't Google. \r\n\r\nUltra-high net worth individuals spend $390 billion per year ($1.3 million each) on lifestyle, but they still struggle to find everything they want. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause the best of any category — homes, boats, restaurant reservations — the best stuff is never listed online. Likewise, the best people don’t need the internet to find a new client or job. \r\n\r\nThe best is always off-market.  Myria is the Off-Marketplace. \r\n\r\nMyria helps off-market sellers reach the nicest and wealthiest buyers. In turn, we help the world’s most successful people access the best of everything, give back, and get the most out of life. \r\n\r\nIf it’s off-market, it’s on Myria! ",
