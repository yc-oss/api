  "long_description": "Broccoli is building the AI-native operating system for home service businesses. Running a plumbing or HVAC company is chaotic—calls, scheduling, dispatch, follow-ups, marketing. We automate all of it so contractors can focus on what they do best: serving customers.\r\n\r\nOur AI agents handle both revenue and ops—answering phones 24/7, booking jobs in real time, following up on leads, and alerting techs when emergencies hit.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown from 0 to 200+ contractors in under a year, raised an unannounced round led by a Tier 1 VC to take on one of the biggest labor automation opportunities in the country.",
