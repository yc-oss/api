  "long_description": "Verdn is a climate-impact API for companies and their end-customers. \r\n\r\nWith Verdn, companies direct a portion of sales towards ecosystem restoration projects (like tree planting, ocean-plastic cleanup, and coral planting), carried out by vetted NGO partners. After each sale, we send the end-customer a tracking dashboard where they can engage with updates about their positive impact.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to Ctrl+Z global ecosystem collapse by making sustainability profitable. We have planted 1,500,000 trees, recovered 400,000 kg of ocean-bound plastic and 150 m2 of coral reef, and have over 100+ paying customers that are seeing a 10x boost in engagement.",
