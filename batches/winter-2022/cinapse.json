  "long_description": "Cinapse is reimagining the production schedule: the foundation of every film and TV project. We’re building the OS of Hollywood, starting with the tool that filmmakers use every day.\r\n\r\nBesides the script, nothing is more foundational to filmmaking. There’s no accurate budget without a schedule. No execution plan without one. The schedule is the map that takes us from idea to image.\r\n\r\nCinapse helps filmmakers draw that map better, faster, and together.  ",
