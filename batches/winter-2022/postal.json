  "long_description": "Postal offers a modern virtual mailbox for businesses. Postal provides an official address for government, IRS, and vendor communications so companies don't have to use an apartment / shared office address.\r\n\r\nPostal's AI summarizes mail and recommends compliance actions, and its marketplace of service providers are ready to perform the mundane compliance work that otherwise falls through the cracks. \r\n\r\nCompanies get 6 months free (a $300 value), plus three free hours of compliance services (a $600 value).
