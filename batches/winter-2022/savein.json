  "long_description": "SaveIN connects people with quality healthcare practices near them and enables them to split their entire medical and wellness bills into monthly instalments. \r\n\r\nOver 80% of healthcare expense in India is borne out of pocket since less than 10% of Indians have private health insurance. On top of this medical inflation is 15% per annum, thereby making paying for private care expensive and frictional.\r\n\r\n5000+ healthcare practices in India now use SaveIN to be discovered by millions of high intent customers near them and offer instant, monthly payment plans for all healthcare services, thereby making it a win-win proposition for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
