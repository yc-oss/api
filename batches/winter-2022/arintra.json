Arintra is solving this problem by automating medical coding using AI and clinical NLP. Arintra converts a patient chart instantly into insurance claims with 96% accurate medical codes and zero human intervention.\r\n\r\nArintra has processed more than 1.63 million claims this year across its 20+ provider clients that includes health systems and large physician groups. Through automation of these charts, Arintra has reduced undercoding by 11% and coding-related claim denials by 43%.
