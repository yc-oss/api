Arintra is solving this problem by automating medical coding using clinical AI. Arintra converts a patient chart instantly into insurance claims with 96% accurate medical codes and zero human intervention.\r\n\r\nArintra has partnered with several provider clients that includes health systems and large physician groups with 100% success. Through automation of these charts, Arintra has reduced undercoding by 11% and coding-related claim denials by 43%. Arintra is headquartered in Austin, Texas. \r\n\r\nArintra is bi-directionally integrated with leading EHRs including Epic, Athena, Cerner, etc. to process patient charts directly from the EHR to create a direct-to-billing claim. This direct-to-billing claim includes precise E/M levels, CPT, ICD-10, HCC, HCPCS codes with appropriate modifiers and units.\r\n\r\nBoth founders have PhDs in AI, significant ML and NLP experience, 60+ patents and publications, and a combined 20+ years of experience working at B2B companies and startups in Silicon Valley.",
