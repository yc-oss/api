  "long_description": "Emebedding third-party apps and websites can often be a nightmare due to incompatible platforms, security issues, and poor UX. Adding multiplayer functionality to these embeds makes this problem exponentially more difficult.\r\n\r\nEnter Hyperbeam—an API that lets you embed virtual computers anywhere, including web, mobile, VR, and even VSCode. You can then open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants, and add multi-user control with just a few lines of code. Uses cases and customer segments include remote learning, virtual offices, online casinos, productivity, watch parties and more.\r\n\r\nWe are three technical founders from the University of Waterloo, and worked as engineers at Facebook, Yahoo, and Lyft. Our technology is battle-tested–we currently stream over 1.25M hours of video per month across every continent. https://hyperbeam.com?ch=yc",
