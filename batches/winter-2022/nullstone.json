  "long_description": "Nullstone is a suite of tools delivered as a single product that enables developer self-service while accommodating flexibility and control that platform engineers need to maintain secure, compliant, performant, and reliable infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNullstone provides a simple developer experience that guides developers through the architecture and release of cloud apps. By default, infrastructure launched through Nullstone is compliance-certified and vetted for security best practices. The software delivery process can be customized per app through external CI/CD tools or IaC tools like Terraform to meet the specific needs of customers or to optimize developer workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNullstone comes with many quality-of-life features that are hard to build with an in-house DevOps/Platform team: Auto-Build/Deploy, Preview Environments, GitOps, and Automatic Secrets Management.\r\n",
