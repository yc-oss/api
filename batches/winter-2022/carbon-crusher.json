  "long_description": "We are crushing roads in need of maintenance, reusing the old road materials, replacing heavy oil with carbon binding lignin. This is both a cheaper, more durable and net carbon negative method, removing ~1.5 tonnes CO2 from the atmosphere from every 100 feet of road. \r\n\r\nWe offer Crushing As A Service (CRAAS) to public and private road owners and refurbishers, and are already gaining international traction. Using satellite imagery, we will monitor road status and potential, and will offer additional tech and bio enhancements to make all roads green and a solution to the climate crisis.  \r\n\r\nWe are building the road to a carbon negative future.
