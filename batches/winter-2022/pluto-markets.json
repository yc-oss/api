This was the case when the phone, the internet and apps were invented granting access for more people.\r\n\r\nFor 100m Europeans living in countries without the Euro however, there has been no innovation for the past 30 years. High commissions, clunky interface, high minimum amounts and a brand that speaks to the few.\r\n\r\nWe are on a mission to drive financial inclusion by bridging the innovation gap for the overlooked regions of the EU.
