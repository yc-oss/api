  "long_description": "Sphere is an AI-powered cross-border tax compliance platform. \r\n\r\nWe help companies like Eleven Labs, Replit and Windsurf automate their sales tax, VAT, GST compliance obligations. \r\n\r\nWhat makes us different to other vendors on the market is: \r\n\r\n1. we have spent the last 1.5 years building local rails into tax authorities in both the US and internationally to properly automate compliance processes (no other vendor has done this), and \r\n2. we're building the world's first AI-native tax engine (which will be the foundation for a broader cross border compliance platform; think Deel for international billing).",
