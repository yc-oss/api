You can get an Airworker the same way you get an Uber, except instead of a taxi, someone shows up at your work site to work for the day.\r\n\r\nAirwork fills 98% of shifts in 2 hours. We're currently live in 8 industries across Southern Ontario, Canada, and customers include Tesla, the Toronto Pearson Airport, and the CNE.\r\n\r\nWe're funded by YCombinator, Expa, Village Global, and SHL Capital.",
