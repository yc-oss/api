  "long_description": "⚡️Olympian manufactures timeless, art-deco electric vehicles. We challenge today’s mundane, over-standardized car designs produced by the traditional automotive industry.\r\n\r\n► Olympian EVs are powered by an open, modular EV architecture. We are pioneering a new modular production model in the U.S., delivering 85–90% reductions in tooling and machinery costs, and achieved 60–80% faster production-lead-times compared to legacy automakers in the U.S.\r\n\r\n💸 Revenue Backlog: $61M+\r\n🚗 Number of Orders: 790+\r\n🏭 Production Capacity: 2,400 units in 2026\r\n✅ Backed by: YC, NVIDIA, Climate Capital, Mobility Vision, Amazon AWS, Soma & Collaborative.\r\n\r\n--\r\nOlympian has two pillars:\r\n1) Art-deco, aesthetic, but simple electric cars\r\n2) Modular EV architecture that enables rapid, cost-efficient production.\r\n\r\nOlympian rejects today's mundane and over-standardized car experience.   We challenge the 40-year status-quo in automotive design, and bring aesthetic, simplicity and color back to the cars. \r\n\r\nWe are manufacturing electric vehicles with our innovative 'modular' vehicle & drivetrain architecture (MVDS), providing Olympian with strong cost and lead-time advantages compared to legacy automakers like Tesla and Ford. Olympian is disrupting 120+ years old automotive industry and targeting to capture 7% market share in the U.S. automotive market by 2030.\r\n\r\nOlympian developed a fully-decoupled, modular, EV drivetrain system (eMVDS) that provides a 'Lego-like' vehicle architecture. Built on 4-core-hardware and 2-core software modules, Olympus eMVDS platform unlocks 80% reduction in tooling & machinery costs and built ~60% faster production lead time. ",
