Instead of borrowing from informal lenders or family, micro business owners download the Numida app, apply in minutes, and receive capital within a day. We have figured out how to score and disburse unsecured loans to cash-based businesses that have no digital transaction history, while maintaining excellent collection rates. Since 2021 we have provided $23M in working capital to 32,000 businesses in East Africa. \r\n",
