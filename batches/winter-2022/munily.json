  "long_description": "There are three key roles among a community:\r\n\r\nThe security Guard\r\nThe resident \r\nThe administrator \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a visitor tries to access a designated community, the security guard must require an ID previously to allow entry. \r\n\r\nHe proceeds to communicate with a specific resident through a intercom which is almost always broken or under repair, delaying the visitor’s entry to the compound \r\n\r\n\r\nWE come in, by interconnecting the security guard with the resident and the administrators through an app and a tablet we provide to make all the process of access pretty smooth and easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a visitor comes in, the security guard must only:\r\n\r\nTake a picture of its ID, using the tablet, \r\nSelect the apartment, so the resident receives a pop up notification through which they can deny or approve the access. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, An even easier way has been developed by Munily which utilizes QR codes generated through Whatsapp. Which visitors just show and security guards scan to allow entry.  \r\n\r\n",
