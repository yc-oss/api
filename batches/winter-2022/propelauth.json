  "long_description": "PropelAuth provides the right level of authentication for all stages of a company. New startups can use our hosted pre-built UIs which provide the simplest possible integration. Out of the box, our customers immediately have the same auth experience as large tech companies like Slack. As those startups grow, they can use our APIs and component libraries to pull aspects of the experience into their product.\r\n\r\nMore than just authentication, we will also provide useful functions tied to a \"user\" or \"organization\", like analytics, billing/subscriptions, referral programs, etc.",
