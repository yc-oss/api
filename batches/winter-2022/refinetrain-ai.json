  "long_description": "We rewrite and optimise your internal documentation for AI, giving it deep enterprise context. This unlocks substantially better LLM results across all AI workflows.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM:\r\n--------------\r\n• AI teams struggle with LLM accuracy building AI workflows and agents because of messy, conflicting, fragmented internal knowledge.\r\n• Internal knowledge conflicts, uses undefined jargon and rely on unstated company assumptions & context.\r\n• LLMs are like Day 0 fresh hires – they can’t understand this documentation properly without someone explaining context to them.\r\n• Furthermore, vector search suffers from poorer retrieval accuracy when company context and terms are not present in a knowledge article\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO\r\n-------------------\r\n• Clean & De-Conflict: Our AI agents read every doc, resolve contradictions, and builds content relationships.\r\n\r\n• Context Distillation: Our AI agents read & compare related docs, distills context and rewrites an LLM-optimised version of your internal documentation. Optional human-approval ensures 100% confidence in the output.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTCOME\r\n----------------------\r\n• Agents and chatbots that actually understand your enterprise context.\r\n• Retrieval that delivers precise, policy-aligned answers on the first try.\r\n• A living knowledge base that stays synchronized with every new doc revision.\r\n",
