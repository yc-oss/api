  "long_description": "Bunkyr enables companies to protect their users’ data with a simple, hardware-secured API. When a user forgets their password, applications using Bunkyr can provide them a familiar, robust recovery method to restore access to encrypted data.\r\n\r\nZero-Knowledge architectures and end-to-end encryption are the only true safeguards against data breaches, but come with large user-experience burdens and engineering overhead. Bunkyr eliminates these obstacles in a way that is friendly to both developers and users, cost-effective, and extremely fast.\r\n\r\nUsers won’t even know Bunkyr exists, while their data stays protected against both breaches and lost passwords.",
