  "long_description": "Kenobi is personalizing the internet. Your marketing site is your front desk to the internet, but its content has to be applicable to all of your ICPs and potential visitors, usually resulting in fragmented and blunt brochure content.\r\n\r\nKenobi acts as your concierge, ensuring each of your visitors receives content that is tailored to _them_ so that they actually convert and progress along your sales journey. You can install Kenobi with one `<head />` tag in your site's markup -- everything else is taken care of using our AI research + content generation pipeline.",
