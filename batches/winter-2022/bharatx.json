  "long_description": "BharatX was recently acquired by Flipkart, the largest startup in India, to enable Buy Now Pay Later in their own ecosystem as well as bolster their own FinTech play via Super.money. It powers Checkout Financing in their ecosystem currently on Millions of Users.\r\n\r\nBharatX enabled \"Pay in 3\" and \"Pay in X\" parts as a feature on over 1000+ brands, 300+ directly and the rest via Payment Gateway partners. Our product enabled Buy Now Pay Later, in a white-labelled way. For e.g. Flipkart PayLater on Flipkart. We grew 47X to $2.5M ARR in under 6 quarters straight after fumbling for 2 years around PMF and Credit Risk & Fraud. \r\n\r\nWe started out as a platform to provide access to Credit in Developing countries without relying on traditional documentation processes by Banks, which did not give access to hundreds of millions.Over the course of BharatX, we have credit to hundreds of thousands of consumers, including many New to Credit (NTC) users.
