  "long_description": "Cash Flow Portal is an investment management platform for real estate. \r\n\r\nWe launched 5 months ago, and we have 6-figure ARR, growing 50% month over month, with 300 syndicators and 3,000 investors. \r\n\r\nWe’ve grown quickly because I am a syndicator myself. Having raised $20MM for my own deals, I know how painful it is to manually prepare Docusigns, send wire instructions and wrangle investors. I also happen to be friends with 2,000 other syndicators just like me needing a solution for managing their investors. \r\n\r\nI’m not just a syndicator. I spent most of my career as an engineering leader at Lyft, Twitter, and Amazon. \r\n\r\n$20K ARR per syndicator gives us a $2B TAM. Having achieved my own financial freedom through real estate investing, our mission is to serve all real estate investors and help them achieve financial freedom. ",
