  "long_description": "Cozmo AI is building the foundational infrastructure for real-time, low-latency voice automation for regulated enterprises. \r\n\r\nWe enable Fortune 500 and leading insurers to deploy AI Employees that can speak, think, and act across revenue-critical workflows. In one global deployment, our voice-native AI employees managed all inbound and outbound policy calls with zero wait time and full compliance. \r\n\r\nThe verified AI performance not only improved service speed but also surfaced new, qualified leads creating what we call the “efficiency loop,” where AI handles repeatable tasks while humans capture higher-value opportunities. \r\n\r\nEach interaction is governed and auditable through our Agent Protocol Engine (APE™), which provides a transparent trail showing what the AI did, why it did it, and what business outcome it achieved. In industries like insurance, where trust and traceability matter more than speed, verified outcomes have become the new competitive edge. Cozmo AI also supports with foundational voice and agentic infrastructure built for regulated, multilingual markets:\r\n•⁠ ⁠Arabic + English first agents with Gulf dialect understanding. 97+ other languages supported\r\n•⁠ ⁠Sub-1.5 second latency across telephony.\r\n•⁠ ⁠Compliance-ready for local sovereignty laws.\r\n•⁠ ⁠APE Memory Engine for contextual, traceable reasoning.\r\n•⁠ ⁠Forward-Deployed Implementation Pods that integrate AI employees directly into live operations.\r\n\r\nBacked by YCombinator, Dubai Future District Fund and other global VCs we have headquarters in San Francisco and EMEA HQ in Dubai.",
