  "long_description": "At voize, we believe the greatest gift to frontline workers is time - time to care, connect, and be present. Today, that time is lost to admin work that pulls nurses away from what matters most: people. \r\n\r\nWe’re changing that by building the AI companion that frees nurses from admin, giving them back up to 30% of time. We don’t replace humans - we support and amplify their impact. Today, 1,500+ care facilities trust voize, and over 100,000 nurses rely on our AI companion** to ease their daily workload.\r\n\r\nOur mission is backed with a $50M Series A funding led by Balderton Capital, with support from HV Capital, Y Combinator and other leading VCs.",
