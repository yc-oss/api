These digital workers communicate fluently with customers and stakeholders while handling repetitive tasks 24/7. Through our no-code platform, businesses can deploy AI employees that manage entire processes through voice interactions, replacing multiple software tools with unified solutions.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve unveiled 3 powerful AI employees, with more to come:\r\n\r\nLiza (Sales Executive) - Engages in natural voice conversations throughout the sales cycle, from initial prospect calls to negotiations and closure. She handles qualification calls, follow-ups, and maintains CRM records while building rapport through intelligent dialogue.\r\n\r\nAlex (Debt Collector) - Conducts professional voice communications for collections, speaking with customers to arrange payments, negotiate plans, and ensure timely follow-ups while maintaining regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\nZara (Receptionist) - Masters voice-based front-office management, engaging in natural conversations to route calls, schedule appointments, take detailed messages, and resolve customer inquiries with a friendly, professional tone.\r\n\r\nLike the industrial revolution transformed farming, we're revolutionizing workplace communication. By automating routine conversations and tasks, human teams can focus on creativity, problem-solving, and business growth.\r\n\r\nWe're the first in the Middle East and Africa to offer this kind of technology, but we work with businesses all over the world. We're backed by Y Combinator, Goodwater Capital, Dubai Future District Fund, Rebel Fund, and Trampoline Venture Partners, and have raised $4M in our latest round.",
