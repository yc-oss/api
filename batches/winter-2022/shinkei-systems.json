  "long_description": "1.2B lbs of fish are caught everyday yet as little as 1 in 3 fish make it to a plate — most of this waste arises because fish are suffocated on boats or electrocuted on farms. \r\n\r\nSuffocation and inaccurate electrocution create stress and so acidify meat, damage quality and significantly reduce shelf-life. \r\n\r\nArtisanal techniques in high-end sushi multiply shelf-life and taste but, because of the variation in fish, are difficult to perform in a mechanical fashion. \r\n\r\nShinkei automates traditional techniques using robotics to provide long-lasting and delicious fish for farmers and harvesters at scale.",
