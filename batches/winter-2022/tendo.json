  "long_description": "Tendo enables anyone in Africa to sell online with zero upfront inventory - our mobile app connects dropshippers to local wholesalers. The sellers on the platform are able to source products through Tendo and resell items using social commerce tools, such as WhatsApp, arrange delivery, and get paid, all through the Tendo mobile app.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, people who want to sell online need to save money, visit hundreds of suppliers to find a trusted one, and risk losing their capital by stocking up inventory. Beyond this, they need to incur costs for logistics and warehousing. We eliminate all that.\r\n",
