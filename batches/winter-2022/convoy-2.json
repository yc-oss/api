Convoy is exactly that for webhooks.\r\n\r\nEngineering teams today use Convoy to securely send, receive and manage millions of webhooks reliably with robust support for retries, rate limiting, static IPs, circuit breaking, rolling secrets and more.\r\n\r\nWe know both receiving and sending webhooks can become a lot of work to manage, we have built a product to enable engineers to build and ship highly scalable stripe-like webhooks infrastructure.",
