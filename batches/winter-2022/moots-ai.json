  "long_description": "Capturing leads at events is messy. Business cards pile up, contact info gets lost, and key details are forgotten before you’re back at your desk. CRMs are slow and rarely used in real time.\r\n\r\nMoots makes it easy. Just scan a badge or business card to create a new contact on your phone. Moots instantly enriches it with public info like job title, company, and LinkedIn profile. You can dictate notes while it’s fresh, and the app transcribes and attaches them directly to the contact.\r\n\r\nEach interaction builds a knowledge base around that lead—helping you remember who they are, what they care about, and what was discussed. You can find contacts later by event name, meeting date, or custom tags. Moots also reminds you when to follow up and drafts outreach so you can focus on closing, not organizing.\r\n",
