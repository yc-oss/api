  "long_description": "Craniometrix has raised over $21 million to help make dementia suck less.\r\n\r\nDementia is tough – but it can be easier. Turns out, if you give families the right non-clinical coaching and support, you can avoid 30% of hospitalizations for these patients. And Medicare has recently started paying for that coaching.\r\n\r\nWe launched our care navigation service for dementia patients in July of 2025, hit $4M of ARR, and just raised a $15M Series A. \r\n\r\nWe leverage AI to provide best-in-class care, alleviating the burden on providers. Come help us build!",
