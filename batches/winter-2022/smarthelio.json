  "long_description": "SmartHelio provides a software that helps solar utilities automatically predict and prevent downtime disruptions. We help solar utilities to generate extra $200k per plant income on $10k spent using our software, by preventing 700 faults per year.\r\n\r\nWe have a platform which reads live data (current, voltage, weather parameters) from a solar plant, runs algorithms to decouple various factors for the underperformance and provides recommendations to fix it. This data is 100% available for the large scale solar in the world just using software (e.g. APIs). \r\n\r\nProduct launch: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/heliocloud\r\n\r\nOur cloud software is being used by 40+ leading solar developers in Europe and Asia. We have analyzed 25+ billion of  data points from over 3 GW of solar assets spread across the globe in the last 2 years. \r\n",
