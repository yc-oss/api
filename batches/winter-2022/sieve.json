  "long_description": "Sieve is the only AI research lab exclusively focused on video data.\r\n\r\nVideo already makes up 80% of internet traffic and has become the dominant medium driving creativity, communication, gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. Unlocking the ability to truly model video is the key to breakthroughs across all of these domains but progress has been bottlenecked by one thing: high-quality training data. That’s where Sieve comes in.\r\n\r\nWe bring together exabyte-scale video infrastructure, novel video understanding techniques, and dozens of diverse data sources to create datasets that push the frontier of video modeling. This unique combination allows us to deliver data with unmatched precision, quality, and speed which has earned the trust of frontier AI labs, Fortune 100 companies, and fast-growing generative AI startups.",
