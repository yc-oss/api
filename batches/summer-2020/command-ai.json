  "long_description": "At Command AI, we believe in a world where the internet “just works” for every visitor, customer, and user. As the internet has become more powerful and crowded, it has become harder for everyone to use. And the solutions we’ve come up with to date — like irritating chatbots and pestering popups — end up being ignored or even annoying users more than they help.\r\n\r\nWe sell tools to software builders and buyers to help them make their software better for users.\r\n\r\nWe call this as our User Assistance Platform, and it comes in 2 pieces:\r\n- AI Agent — an AI chat agent that can answer users questions, perform actions for them, and even co-browse with them to teach your interface.\r\n\r\n- Nudge Platform — AI-assisted nudges, hints, and messages to guide users in personalized ways that don’t annoy them. We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",
