  "long_description": "The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy, but the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken; the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with hidden fee structures. \r\n\r\nAtoB is building Stripe for Transportation â€” modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics, where capital movement occurs quickly and transparently. Our flagship product is the AtoB Fuel Card, a zero-fee fuel card accepted anywhere built for fleets of all shapes and sizes.",
