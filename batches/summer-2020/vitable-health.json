Calendly.com/ichra-vitablehealth\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of engineers, clinicians, and operators redesigning how healthcare works for the 80 million uninsured and underinsured Americans. We started with a vertically integrated primary and urgent care health plan delivered by nurse practitioners through virtual and in-home visits. Today, we combine ICHRA administration with direct primary care, offering free virtual visits, over 1,000 prescriptions, and 40+ lab tests, managing everything from onboarding to high-touch care that both hourly workers their employers rely on.\r\n\r\nWe're backed by world-class investors like Cherryrock, First Round Capital, Y Combinator, Softbank along with incredible founders and operators with experience building and funding unicorns like Michael Seibel (YC, Twitch), Immad Akhund (Mercury), Allison Pickens (Gainsight), Jack Altman (Lattice), Dan Folkman (GoPuff) and others.",
