  "long_description": "WebRTC is the reason we’ve stayed connected and productive during the COVID era, powering most of the browser-based video communications platforms you use every day (Google Meet, Facebook Messenger, etc.). But when a call gets dropped or the audio cuts out, it’s hard for the video developers to understand why it happened. This is a major problem for new players in the video chat industry that lose customers because of call quality issues; customers should be able to use video platforms with the features they want without having to sacrifice call quality.",
