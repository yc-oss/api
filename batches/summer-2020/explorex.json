  "long_description": "The Indian restaurant industry has already adopted technology to adapt to the growing demands and match the expectations of today's customers but the absence of a full-stack cloud-based software is extremely frustrating to business owners today. The existing systems lack modularity, lack the ability to integrate with services, and hence aren't plug and play. Also, Restaurants are extremely frustrated with all the 5-6 independent systems that don't talk to each other. \r\n\r\nWe are solving these problems by building a full-stack solution for the 30 million+ restaurants in India, by solving order management, operations management, online delivery, payment processing, reports & analytics, and guest identification and re-engagement all using one system - Explorex.",
