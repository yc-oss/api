  "long_description": "Today the building design process is cumbersome and expensive. Architects submit their design to structural engineers for validation. Engineers need to design all structural elements such as walls, columns, and beams to ensure the structure will not collapse and complies with regulations.  The structural engineer needs four to six weeks to generate the initial solution. The engineer will submit his proposal to the architect and then engage in an extensive back and forth discussion until they agree on a satisfying solution. TANGObuilder generates the building structural design in real-time, cutting six weeks of the overall process, and reducing material usage by 30%.",
