  "long_description": "Atomized helps developers launch applications in the cloud faster by deploying and managing the necessary infrastructure for you. Simply connect up your Github repo and your AWS account, and we'll handle the rest!\r\n\r\nThe best part is that all the infrastructure runs in your AWS account, and you have full ownership and visibility into it. No more black boxes that you can't troubleshoot and manage.\r\n\r\nWe want to empower engineers to build, deploy, secure, and monitor infrastructure faster than ever. Our long-term vision is to be the go-to platform to get started and to be able to manage all things cloud - no matter which cloud provider you choose.",
