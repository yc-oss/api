  "long_description": "Swif.ai is a real-time device compliance and security platform that keeps every Mac, Windows, and Linux endpoint secure and audit-ready. Our lightweight agent enforces policies (encryption, patching, app controls) as people work, auto-remediates drift, and streams audit evidence to tools like Vanta and Drata. Unlike legacy MDM or “after-the-fact” compliance software, Swif.ai delivers enforcement—not just reports—plus device-level Shadow IT/AI governance to detect and block risky or unauthorized SaaS and LLM tools.\r\n\r\nEnterprises choose Swif.ai for true multi-OS coverage in a single pane of glass, one-click remediation, and fast time-to-value via silent installers and native integrations with Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace (conditional access by device posture). The result is fewer tools to manage, shorter audits, and stronger security with lower operational burden. Swif.ai is SOC 2 Type II. Our near-term roadmap adds Safe-AI controls for regulated industries, AI-agent monitoring, and integrated vulnerability detection with one-click fixes—expanding our lead as the enforcement layer for endpoint compliance and AI security.\r\n",
