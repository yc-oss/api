  "long_description": "Step 1: We find you warm leads: contacts + companies that are showing interest on your website (via 6sense/Clearbit) and researching you around the web (via Bombora) but haven't converted yet.\r\n\r\nStep 2: We then auto follow up via chat, email or LinkedIn. Depends what workflows you want to set up - we can AI chat with them on your website, auto AI email them via your sequence provider of choice, and/or auto AI linkedin sequence them. Your humans can verify everything before being sent too. \r\n\r\nOutcome: 10x more outbound than a human SDR, 3x reply rates since they're warm and more booked meetings (results shown in ROI dashboard). \r\n\r\nP.S. if you want to use humans: you can send 1-click warm intro requests via your network or live chat/video call them too.\r\n\r\nThis is the power of an autonomous sales orchestration platform and we have 100+ paying customers who can back it up.\r\n ",
