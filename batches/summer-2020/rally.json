Users can hop between groups easily, while seeing and hearing the other groups around them, as if they were in a shared space.   \r\nRally is perfect for happy hours, networking, and other social gatherings. We are being used by institutions like Amazon, Harvard and a multitude of startups across North America. \r\n",
