  "long_description": "Over 70% of B2B trade still happens through emails, PDFs, texts, and phone calls.\r\nNot because companies prefer it – but because their customers do.\r\n\r\nThis is the default ordering workflow across industries, and despite decades of ERP software, it remains largely manual.\r\n\r\nResponse provides the infrastructure for this reality.\r\nWe turn unstructured customer messages into clean, system-ready sales orders automatically, flowing directly into the ERP for approval or execution.\r\n\r\nBy automating the space between customer intent and systems of record, Response lets operators scale order volume without hiring more people, outsourcing labor, or retraining customers.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the missing automation layer for how B2B trade actually works.",
