  "long_description": "Glimpse helps retail brands automate their identify and fight invalid fees & streamline the cash reconciliation process &  from their retailers & distributors using AI. Imagine a beverage company sold $100k worth of goods to Whole Foods & only got paid $60k. The deducted $40k comes in hundreds of long PDFâ€™s with obscure codes that a team has to manually review every single one of to ensure the fees are valid. A % of these fees are always invalid and brands have to go through a lengthy process to get back money owed to them. We automate this whole process - saving a brand dozens of hours a week & recouping them 2-3% of their topline sales. Our vision is to become an AI BPO for retail brands. ",
