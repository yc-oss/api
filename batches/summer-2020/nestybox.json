  "long_description": "Nestybox creates software that enables Linux containers to act like virtual machines. This increases the use cases for containers and gives enterprises a less expensive and more flexible alternative to virtual machines in many scenarios. \r\n\r\nOur first product is a \"container runtime\", the software that creates the containers. It's called \"Sysbox\" and integrates with the popular Docker and Kubernetes engines, enabling these tools to deploy containers that act like virtual machines. \r\n\r\nThis technology provides software engineers with an alternative to VMs, one that easier to use, much more efficiency, and easily migrated across clouds.\r\n\r\nHacker News Launch: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24084758",
