  "long_description": "Trident Bioscience builds tools to expedite the discovery and optimization of useful proteins. Our technology first applies predictive models of protein structure and function to generate sets of potentially active protein sequences. We then apply our state-of-the-art sequence optimization algorithm to design gene libraries capable of testing these candidates extremely quickly and affordably. By combining these technologies, we're closing the design-build-test loop of protein optimization and cutting the total cycle time to help bring synthetic proteins to market faster than ever before.",
