  "long_description": "SuperTokens is building open source authentication (as an alternative to Auth0, Firebase and AWS Cognito). Add secure, hassle free authentication to your app in 1 day. We enable startups to launch quicker and focus on their core product offering\r\n\r\n1. We're easier to implement as we take a modular approach - making it possible to pick only the features you need for your use case. This means you need not worry about complications associated with other features (eg: SSO and OAuth if you donâ€™t need it) and this in turn makes it easier to implement and manage SuperTokens.\r\n2. Developer's can own and manage their user's data. \r\n3. SuperTokens can be run on your premise for free and also has a generous hosted tier for those who dont want to manage it themselves.\r\n\r\nSuperTokens is being used by hundreds of developers across the globe.",
