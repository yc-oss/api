  "long_description": "Deasy Labs provides metadata orchestration for AI workflows. Deasie's platform provides the best way for AI teams to create and embed high-quality, customized metadata into their AI workflows (e.g., RAG, Agentic frameworks).\r\n\r\nOur three founders (from Amazon, McKinsey/QuantumBlack & MIT) previously built an ML data governance tool from 0 to 1 within McKinsey, which we deployed with 11 Fortune 500 companies. We saw in early 2023 the ability to create high-quality metadata (without reliance on domain experts) would be a key factor in achieving the accuracy & speed in GenAI applications required for production.  \r\n\r\nOur investors include General Catalyst, Y Combinator, RTP Global and world experts in enterprise data.
