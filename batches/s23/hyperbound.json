  "long_description": "Hyperbound is a simulated AI sales roleplay platform that turns ICP descriptions into interactive AI buyers in less than 2 minutes. It helps your sales team onboard 50% faster and boosts your team's conversions on cold, warm, & discovery calls.\r\n\r\nEvery sales team wants to do more roleplays, but it's often unscalable and biased. Instead of having your sellers practice on real prospects and burn leads in the process, Hyperbound allows your reps to get realistic at-bats with an AI buyer. Sellers can finally gain call confidence and mastery in a simulated environment that doesn't put your pipeline at risk and gives time back to your managers.Â \r\n\r\nInterested in trying it out today? Start a free demo simulation at https://app.hyperbound.ai/buyers?invite=bookface and contact us at founders@hyperbound.ai for next steps. ",
