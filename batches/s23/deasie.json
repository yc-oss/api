  "long_description": "Deasie is a data governance layer to support safe & reliable use of language models in the enterprise. Our product connects to thousands of documents, auto-tags everything in terms of contents & sensitivity, and ensures that AI models are only ever fed with data that is relevant, safe & high-quality.\r\n\r\nOur three founders (from Amazon, McKinsey/QuantumBlack & MIT) previously built an ML data governance tool from 0 to 1 within McKinsey, which we deployed with 11 Fortune 500 companies. We saw in early 2023 that the single greatest blocker to reliable and scalable adoption of GenAI, was the inability for enterprises to identify the right set of documents that should be used for a given application. \r\n\r\nOur investors include General Catalyst, Y Combinator, RTP Global and world experts in enterprise data.
