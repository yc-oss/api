  "long_description": "Casca is building AGI for banking.\r\n\r\nWe are replacing 30+ year-old legacy technology with AI-native systems of record that automate 90% of the manual work humans used to have to do. \r\n\r\nOur first product is an AI-native Loan Origination System - with a built-in AI Agent, called Sarah. Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\r\n\r\nWhy? Small businesses are the heart of the American economy and a lot of banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes and unlocks affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US as opposed to the high interest rates from online lenders.",
