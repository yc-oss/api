  "long_description": "truemetrics helps logistics companies to find their customer's faster. By detecting and mapping entrances, we help GLS, a key logistics company in Europe, save 2-10 minutes on each delivery.\r\n\r\nThe way couriers navigate is broken.\r\n\r\n“You Have Arrived At Your Destination!” — or so Google Maps thinks. In reality, the way couriers navigate is broken: No parking, hard-to-find entrances, and labyrinth-like apartment and office complexes can turn the last meters of delivery into a time-consuming puzzle.\r\n\r\ntruemetrics provides parking positions and entrance locations to enable faster drop-offs. Our data is generated by analyzing sensor data from drivers' smartphones, allowing truemetrics to identify precise parking and entrance locations, thereby simplifying the last meters of delivery.\r\n",
