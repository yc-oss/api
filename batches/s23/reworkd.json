  "long_description": "At Reworkd, we're working on multimodal LLM agents that serve as the simplest way to extract web data at scale. Customers come to us with lists of 100s to 1000s of websites along with a data schema. Our agents traverse these websites, understand their structure, and generate code to extract data from them.\r\n\r\nWe've been working on LLM agents since their inception and have received over 30k stars on GitHub and 1M+ users across previous agent products. If you're interested in our pilot program, shoot us an email!",
