  "long_description": "We’re building tools to help companies collect richer customer data and convert more website visitors to customers.\r\n\r\nEvery business site has some sort of a Contact Us, Talk to Sales, Request Demo, or other type of intake form designed to collect data from their users. But the majority of these forms are extremely under-optimized and lack the rich analytics and personalization capabilities needed to truly engage users. \r\n\r\nWe've optimized forms, self-serve pipelines, and ran experiments alongside growth teams at companies like Snowflake and various startups and know exactly what is needed to enable better business forms.",
