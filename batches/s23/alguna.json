  "long_description": "We are Alguna, an early-stage startup building a modern pricing, quoting, and billing platform for B2B companies.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to build the most efficient revenue management engine for B2B SaaS. \r\n\r\nToday, most companies get by using spreadsheets and manual processes across multiple single-point solutions, which is inefficient and costs millions in lost revenue.\r\n\r\nWe solve this by unifying the quote-to-revenue process and automating complex back-office operations. This enables our customers (growth-stage startups and enterprises) to flexibly close more deals faster without worrying about internal limitations and relying on finance and engineering teams.\r\n",
