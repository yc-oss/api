  "long_description": "Healthtech-1 automates repetitive processes for healthcare systems. We’re starting with the world’s most famous: the NHS. We’re already live in over 400+ primary care practices.\r\n\r\nBased out of Raj's parents' Primary Care practice the Healthtech 1 team are systematically digitising the repetitive processes they experience everyday, saving thousands of hours of staff time. \r\n\r\nWhy now? \r\nThe UK's National Health Service (NHS) delivers free healthcare in 590 million patient contacts every year. Post-pandemic, Britain's most treasured institution is in crisis. Patient satisfaction is at 25 year low and 1/7 staff are applying for Non-NHS jobs fuelling an 11% recruitment gap. \r\n\r\nBy digitising the 100s of repetitive processes in healthcare, Healthtech 1 will reverse the trend, and produce the world's most productive health care system.",
