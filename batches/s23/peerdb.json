  "long_description": "At PeerDB, we are building a fast, simple and the most cost effective way to stream data from Postgres to Data Warehouses, Queues and Storage engines. If you are running Postgres at the heart of your data-stack and move data at scale from Postgres to any of the above targets, PeerDB can provide value.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe support different modes of streaming - log based (CDC), cursor based (timestamp or integer) and XMIN based. Performance wise, we are 10x faster than existing tools. Features wise, we support native Postgres features such as comprehensive set of data-types incl. jsonb/arrays/postgis, efficiently streaming toast columns, schema changes and so on.",
