Instead of spending months on integrations and retrieval pipelines, Reworkd's AgentGPT added our button in an afternoon and let thousands of people connect their Notion, email and Drive instantly.\r\n\r\nEvery single AI company is building data retrieval. Currently, they're doing this from scratch – we don't think they should have to. Just like OpenAI made working with LLMs as simple as an API call, SID makes it easy for every AI company to access data the same way.",
