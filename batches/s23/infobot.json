  "long_description": "By using LLMs to generate news content, we reduce the cost of generating an article by over 1000x. That means that instead of covering just a few dozen topics like the New York Times, we can cover millions of hyper niche topics in the long tail distribution. By changing the cost structure, we are growing the market and creating a new business model for news at scale.\r\n",
