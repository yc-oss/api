  "long_description": "Quack AI tackles the slowdown in project delivery often faced by expanding dev teams. We bring development teams into sync, effortlessly aligning code with project expectations.\r\n\r\nTake the example of the backend team now adopting the syntax of Python 3.11 for asynchronous tasks. Our deep learning model swiftly interprets these updates and embeds them into every developer's keystroke with our VSCode extension, significantly reducing code review iterations and shaping a cohesive & adaptable coding identity.",
