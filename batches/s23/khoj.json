  "long_description": "Khoj is an open-source, personal AI application that helps you get answers to your questions, whether they be in your own notes or online. You can use it to get answers that are grounded in reality, references included. Rather than spending an hour researching collating information from different sources, have Khoj do it for you, easily and quickly. Khoj can also generate images and understand your voice via TTS, so you can work hands-free.\r\n\r\nWith our specialized agents, you can get deeper assistance on topics related to Health, Tutoring, Therapy, or something else altogether. \r\n\r\nBecause we're open-source, you can always choose to self-host Khoj on your own machine for more privacy.\r\n\r\nWe've previously built products for Cortana AI at Microsoft and scaled them from 0 to 20M daily active users.",
