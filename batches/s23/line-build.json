  "long_description": "Line.Build is software for contractors to seamlessly find and apply for financing and rebates for energy efficiency upgrades. With buildings accounting for almost 40% of US GHG emissions, retrofitting for efficiency is essential to reduce emissions and load on the grid, but expensive. Over $80B of rebates, incentives and financing is available but hyper-fragmented across utilities, federal funds, grants, and green lending programs. Line consolidates disparate sources of funds and simplifies finding and applying for incentives and financing.\r\n\r\nLine is designed to be user-friendly, available in multiple languages, and accessible on both web and mobile devices. Additionally, it provides an API that seamlessly integrates with existing quoting tools, enhancing efficiency and convenience.",
