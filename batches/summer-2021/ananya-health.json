  "long_description": "Building a standard-of-care medical device to freeze abnormal cells before they become cervical cancer, in any clinic, anywhere in the world, at 1/10 the cost.\r\n--\r\nAnanya Health is building a portable cryoablation unit designed for every primary care clinic in the world. Our beachhead application is cervical cancer prevention -- even though cervical cancer is easy to screen for, 80% of clinics worldwide lack the infrastructure and specialized staff to treat at the earliest stages. Our platform technology allows nurses and lower level health workers to treat at the point of care for 1/10 the cost of traditional ablation, and is the only cryo device that will help us achieve the WHO target to eliminate cervical cancer in our lifetime.",
