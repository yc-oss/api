  "long_description": "It is cumbersome to maintain/repair vehicles in Africa. Vehicle owners currently have 2 options to choose from; very expensive and geographically limited branded mechanic garages (less than 1% of the supply pool) or unvetted roadside mechanics (about 99% of the supply pool). \r\n\r\nAbout 95% of vehicle owners cannot afford branded garages where quality and reliable service delivery can be guaranteed and thus rely on roadside mechanics. However, low quality and transparency are typical issues associated with roadside mechanics. \r\n\r\nWe created a network of vetted mechanics, spare part vendors and an app that enables easy booking, payment and mechanic matching process. Via the mecho app, a customer or business can make a request for any automobile service (repairs or regular servicing) or part. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
