  "long_description": "Litnerd is a kids reading + writing club app that grew by 14x this past school year. Think of us as a modern-day Scholastic, with a heavy IP play. We create original IP with our community + partner brands -> turn them into books, media and learning curriculum, layered with an AI personalized tutor to help kids learn to read and write in a personalized and engaging way.\r\n\r\nOur product format is a Social and Gamified - with a live weekly community meetup and monthly e-tournaments. \r\n\r\n- And it works! Litnerd 4x improved the pass rate of students on their annual state Reading (ELA) exam.\r\n- STICKY: Kids spend 10-20 minutes on the Litnerd app OUTSIDE of classroom time.\r\n- KID AUTHORS: Kids are the authors of the books and Litnerd AI helps illustrate + publish the book.\r\n- Built on the Science of Reading\r\n- Original IP: all books, media and courseware is original content created and published by Litnerd.",
