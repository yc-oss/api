  "long_description": "Zaz OS is a “Lovable for internal products”: an AI-native platform with an opinionated infrastructure that makes it easy to build and edit Apps and Agents through vibe-coding. Using spec-driven development, it ensures consistency and security for critical processes, solving challenges like user management, notifications, and multi-app integration within a single interface.\r\n\r\nWith over eight years of experience in back-office and HR, Zaz OS was designed from the ground up with core structural issues already solved and the flexibility to adapt to each company’s unique needs. The result is the speed to build and iterate, combined with the robustness required for mission-critical processes — the ultimate solution to replace the Frankenstein stack of SaaS tools that currently dominates company management.\r\nAs companies grow, the lack of customization of current software forces Heads of HR to buy multiple disconnected tools, allocate engineers to build and maintain people-related projects or use spreadsheets.",
