  "long_description": "We're building the best chat app on earth. Beeper connects to 15+ different chat networks. Unified search, advanced filtering and more. Available on Desktop, Android, iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple: messaging today is painfully fragmented. We're going to fix that.   \r\n\r\nEvery time we communicate there is friction lurking under the surface. E.g. Which app did I message her on? Where's that photo gone? Why can't I join an iMessage group from my Android? Our mission is to eliminate that friction and boost the efficiency of the entire human race.  ",
