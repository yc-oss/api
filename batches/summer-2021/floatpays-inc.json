  "long_description": "Floatpays is an on-demand wage access platform that helps employees access, spend, save and manage their money.\r\n\r\nThe problem we are solving is that more than 75% of the 12 million employed South Africanâ€™s run out of money before the end of the month, 52% of those end up borrowing money to survive. Informal lending is the only option for most borrowers, with interest rates anywhere between 30-50%. The story is the same in most African countries where payday/micro-lending has become the norm amongst lower-income earners.\r\n\r\nOur app features include financial education, a budget planning tool, cash access, and voucher purchases all from wages earned but unpaid. We are currently working on a savings product to promote long-term financial resilience.\r\n\t\r\nWe launched our product in South Africa in July 2020 and plan to extend our reach into additional African countries in 2022 and beyond.",
