Once Abbot joins a room, it summarizes conversations, tags relevant topics, and even suggests next steps. Abbot's Insights make it easy to see your team's responsiveness at a glance. Want to automate common tasks? Abbot's built-in Skills functionality (think: small bits of code we run for you) can be triggered by customer topics, on a schedule, in response to external webhooks, or directly from chat.",
