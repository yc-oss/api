  "long_description": "Charge Robotics is building robots that automate the most labor-intensive parts of solar construction.\r\n\r\nSolar has rapidly become the cheapest form of power generation in many regions. Demand has skyrocketed, and now the primary barrier to getting it installed is labor logistics and bandwidth.\r\n\r\nOur robots remove the labor bottleneck, allowing construction companies to meet the rising demand for solar, and enabling the world to switch to renewables faster.",
