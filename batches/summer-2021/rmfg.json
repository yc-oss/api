  "long_description": "RMFG builds and operates advanced, software-defined factories, manufacturing precision parts and metal assemblies for fast-moving hardware teams. \r\n\r\nOur vertically integrated software platform automates quoting, DFM, scheduling, and machine control, and allows us to ship faster and at lower cost than traditional shops. \r\n\r\nWe build our own computer vision models, AI agents, and custom software to solve problems inside our manufacturing facility. \r\n\r\nToday we primarily build complex metal assemblies using sheet, tube and CNC milled parts. We plan to continually moving upstream, offering more complex manufacturing services including electro-mechanical assembly. \r\n\r\nWe’ve delivered critical parts for companies building custom robots, autonomous farms, PCB factories, weather modification technology, rockets, and more. ",
