Companies like Airbnb and Stripe use Deed to increase employee retention and happiness. Since launching publicly in January, we’ve increased our logo count by 4X with companies like DoorDash, Box, and Lob. We did this by making sure employees have the same awesome experience using their workplace giving tool as they do with their favorite consumer apps.",
