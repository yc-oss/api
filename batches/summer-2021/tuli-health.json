  "long_description": "Tuli health is turning all 11 000 independent pharmacies in the UK into diagnostic centers.  Our software makes it easy for these pharmacies to sell and fulfill COVID-19 tests today and other diagnostic tests tomorrow. Instead of waiting for a long time or travelling a long distance to receive the tests, customers can now receive tests in their neighbourhood, with results guaranteed in 24 hours. \r\n\r\nTuli Health was launched in June, had onboarded 147 pharmacies, performed over 7000 diagnostic tests, and helped pharmacies generate $1.3 million in incremental revenue per month. \r\n\r\nThe vision is to make every local pharmacy into a diagnostic center powered by Tuli Health.
