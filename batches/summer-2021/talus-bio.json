  "long_description": "We have built a platform that enables drug discovery and development for previously undruggable genome regulators (\"the regulome\"). We accomplish this by moving drug discovery out of artificial systems where regulome proteins fail to function properly, and back into live human cells. Our technology combines innovations in automated cell processing, next-gen proteomics, and advanced data analytics to measure a drug's effect on the entire regulome in one experiment. ",
