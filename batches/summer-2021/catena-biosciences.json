  "long_description": "Catenaâ€™s technology lets us attach any two proteins together using an enzyme and the native amino acids tyrosine and cysteine within target proteins. It is a true platform technology because it enables the joining of any two soluble proteins together with minimal engineering and without restrictions due to protein size or complexity. Our work has already been used to modify cancer specific antibodies, CRISPR proteins and even cell surfaces. Our ability to produce modular protein therapeutics in a fraction of the time allows for true library creation across the therapeutics spectrum from oncology, vaccines, inflammatory disease and beyond.\r\n",
