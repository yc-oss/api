  "long_description": "Matrubials is an anti-infectives company, focused on human milk peptides as therapeutics to address antimicrobial resistance and modern diseases. Currently the global rise in severe bacterial infections and the drying pipeline of effective treatments are burdensome for healthcare and economics. Sculpted by evolution, milk, first food for the newborn, provides an exemplary solution to address the nutritive and protective challenges an infant is faced with. The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",
