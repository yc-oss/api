  "long_description": "Keyri helps companies implement simple, secure anti-fraud and authentication solutions to delight users and keep bad actors off their platform. Keyri's mobile application and browser fingerprinting suite ties user identities to trusted devices, preventing fraudulent activity such as account opening, account takeovers, bot attacks, and referral/promo abuse. Keyri is able to establish an immutable device fingerprint for every device, alerting companies of any suspicious devices during sign up, log in, or subsequent authentication events.\r\n\r\nKeyri also offers a passwordless authentication suite that leverages Passkeys, WebAuthn, and QR codes to enable biometric authentication on all platforms and devices, providing a seamless user experience, strengthening multi-factor account security, and reducing reliance on other tedious and unsecure authentication methods.",
