  "long_description": "Zazos is the no-code HR platform. We allow startups to set up unique workspaces that centralize information and tasks for employees. For example, companies can create a home page where people can view stock options, ask for time off, and see everyone's profiles. On Zazos, anyone can build and share people management apps, without knowing how to code.\r\n\r\nAs companies grow, the lack of customization of current software forces Heads of HR to buy multiple disconnected tools, allocate engineers to build and maintain people-related projects or use spreadsheets.",
