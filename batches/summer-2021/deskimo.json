No memberships, no registrations, no long-term commitments needed.\r\n\r\n3) The hybrid work revolution is only getting started\r\nEmployees have no intention to go back to the office 5 days / week post pandemic. This will transform the way companies manage their hybrid workforce and decentralized workplace. Deskimo is at the center of this transformation.",
