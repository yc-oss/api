They struggle to comprehend 25-50% of them, forget 70% within 24 hours and 90% within a week, and have no way to learn and improve from their conversations.\r\n\r\nAR glasses are the only form factor that can augment conversations without disrupting them. They keep your hands free, allow you to maintain eye contact, provide information exactly when needed, and have unfiltered access to everything you hear and see.\r\n\r\nIn 5 years, 4.7 billion smartphone users will use smart glasses. But today's AR glasses are too heavy, conspicuous, and power hungry while failing to provide utility: generic toys without purpose.

Every year, trillions of dollars in venture, real-estate, and private-equity capital are deployed through diligence processes that haven’t changed in decades. Analysts spend hours parsing PDFs and spreadsheets just to understand what a company or property is worth.\r\n\r\nAlt-X is building the data and AI infrastructure layer for alternative assets — a system that ingests unstructured deal materials, normalizes the data, and generates institutional-grade analysis in seconds. Whether it’s a private-company dataroom or a real-estate offering memorandum, Alt-X extracts key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, and cap rate, then produces investor-ready dashboards and reports automatically.\r\n\r\nOur platform reduces deal evaluation timelines by up to 73%, saves 30–50 analyst hours per deal, and enables teams to screen 4× more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating KPI extraction, benchmarking, and underwriting, Alt-X transforms diligence from a manual bottleneck into a scalable process.\r\n\r\nThis hasn’t been done at scale because private-market data is fragmented across formats and asset classes. Alt-X’s parsing engine unifies this chaos into a structured schema — the backbone for cross-asset underwriting, KPI dashboards, and automated risk scoring.\r\n\r\nOur first wedge is real estate and private equity, where underwriting is slowest and most manual. We’re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200 million in assets, paying $1K–$5K per month to automate deal screening and valuation.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: over $1.4 trillion in new private-equity and real-estate deals are underwritten globally each year, with $25–30 billion spent on diligence and analytics. Yet over 90% of this still happens manually. Alt-X’s mission is to become the operating system for private-market investing — the Bloomberg Terminal of the AI era.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

    "long_description": "Pixley is revolutionizing early education. No more passive learning: lectures, worksheets, deskwork. Kids don’t just watch content – they create it. With Pixley, any drawing or picture becomes an animated character, and every episode is shaped by the child’s imagination.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, parents have complete control over what their kids learn. They choose the academic or moral lesson each story teaches, making screen time both safe and educational. For the first time, children and parents have complete control of the media they consume.\r\n\r\nWe’re harnessing brand-new video gen technology that’s set to revolutionize how the world creates and learns. Generating animated, narrative-consistent content from a child’s input in real time demands breakthroughs in generative AI, safety, and personalization – and Pixley has cracked it.\r\n\r\nThe market opportunity is massive. Families already spend billions on streaming and educational media, but the content is one-size-fits-all. By giving kids a true voice in what they watch, while giving parents control, Pixley makes early education personal, fun, and effective.\r\n\r\nWe are college dropouts that have been building together for years, winning several hackathons and working with video gen along the way. We built Pixley after we saw the flood of low-quality, algorithmic AI content and knew that kids and parents deserved better.  ",

Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this). The idea came after a YC partner told us: founders at B2B companies are experts at their jobs, but consistently struggle to turn that expertise into marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched in mid-July, now serve 30+ paying customers including 14 YC companies (Conduit W24, Prism X25, Freya AI S25, Strac W22, Hyperspell F25) plus VCs, global franchises, and ghostwriting agencies. Achieving minimum 30%-70% week to week growth.\r\n\r\n💡 Results:\r\n$10 M+ total revenue generated across clients\r\n$5 M deal closed from a single LinkedIn post\r\n$40 K inbound revenue in 1.5 weeks for one client\r\n200+ qualified inbounds in 1 month after hitting content-market fit\r\n\r\nWe’re not just another AI tool.\r\n\r\nWe’re forward-deployed content engineers, building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company.\r\n\r\n📅 Book a demo: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost\r\n\r\n🔗 Connect with Sky: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",

For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe met a decade ago at McGill University and have been building together full time for over 2 years.

Most people don’t realize how much craft that takes — so most AI ads end up looking like slop.\r\n\r\nAbsurd replaces that process with autonomous AI agents, guided by a team of creative directors, to create production-quality videos in 72 hours. These agents collaborate with your team on Slack to plan, script, and generate every scene on an interactive canvas. From the canvas, your team can watch shotlists, image frames, and video renders come to life in real time — commenting, iterating, or generating new ideas alongside the agents.\r\n\r\nTry it today at tryabsurd.com",

The FAA records four to five runway incursions every day, and over 90% of air traffic control facilities are operating below target staffing levels.
