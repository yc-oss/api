Every year, trillions of dollars in venture, real-estate, and private-equity capital are deployed through diligence processes that haven’t changed in decades. Analysts spend hours parsing PDFs and spreadsheets just to understand what a company or property is worth.\r\n\r\nAlt-X is building the data and AI infrastructure layer for alternative assets — a system that ingests unstructured deal materials, normalizes the data, and generates institutional-grade analysis in seconds. Whether it’s a private-company dataroom or a real-estate offering memorandum, Alt-X extracts key KPIs like ARR, growth, NOI, IRR, and cap rate, then produces investor-ready dashboards and reports automatically.\r\n\r\nOur platform reduces deal evaluation timelines by up to 73%, saves 30–50 analyst hours per deal, and enables teams to screen 4× more opportunities with the same headcount. By automating KPI extraction, benchmarking, and underwriting, Alt-X transforms diligence from a manual bottleneck into a scalable process.\r\n\r\nThis hasn’t been done at scale because private-market data is fragmented across formats and asset classes. Alt-X’s parsing engine unifies this chaos into a structured schema — the backbone for cross-asset underwriting, KPI dashboards, and automated risk scoring.\r\n\r\nOur first wedge is real estate and private equity, where underwriting is slowest and most manual. We’re already piloting with family offices and private funds managing over $200 million in assets, paying $1K–$5K per month to automate deal screening and valuation.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: over $1.4 trillion in new private-equity and real-estate deals are underwritten globally each year, with $25–30 billion spent on diligence and analytics. Yet over 90% of this still happens manually. Alt-X’s mission is to become the operating system for private-market investing — the Bloomberg Terminal of the AI era.",

Teams write rules that define what's sensitive and who should access it, and Velum enforces them consistently across all systems. When authorization changes, we can reveal tokenized data just-in-time for approved recipients, maintaining both security and utility.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly into your existing infrastructure. For AI workflows, we intercept prompts, responses, and retrievals to prevent sensitive information from leaking into or out of models. For enterprise systems like Salesforce, SAP, or Workday, we extend policy enforcement to exports, reports, and syncs.\r\n\r\nVelum is designed for scale and compliance. We provide encryption and structure-preserving tokenization for high-throughput pipelines, with multi-cloud deployment options and configurable data residency per tenant to meet your compliance requirements.",

Instead, they waste weeks configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed systems, and optimizing their GPU code. We know because we lived it: While training our own models across thousands of GPUs earlier this year, we spent more time fighting our infrastructure than doing actual research.\r\n\r\nThat why we're building two things. First, Elastic Cloud: a managed platform that automatically finds the cheapest GPUs across all providers, handles spot instance preemption, and cuts compute costs by up to 80%. Second, automatic kernel optimization that makes training code run faster by modeling hardware topology, often beating hand-tuned implementations.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that getting high performance across different hardware is genuinely hard. NVIDIA's CUDA moat exists because writing fast kernels requires deep expertise. Most teams either accept vendor lock-in or hire expensive kernel engineers. Our goal is to break the CUDA moat.\r\n\r\nThe compute bottleneck is the biggest constraint on AI progress. NVIDIA can't manufacture enough GPUs, and their monopoly keeps prices astronomical. Meanwhile, AMD, Google, and Amazon are shipping capable alternative hardware that nobody uses because the software is too hard. We're breaking that moat. If we succeed, anyone will be able to train state-of-the-art models without thinking past their PyTorch code.",

We built the first version just for him.\r\n\r\nNow we give hotel groups the reliable AI they need, so they never lose a booking on the phone again.",

Instead of executives spending 8+ hours a week trying to create content, our forward-deployed content engineers perform deep research to understand who you are -> your voice, your clients' pain points, your unique insights -> then ship and optimize content that books meetings at named accounts.\r\n\r\nOur college-dropout, second-time founding team includes Sky Yang (raised $150M as UCSD's youngest Student Body President) and Neo Lee (a Berkeley Math/AI researcher who dropped out to build this). The idea came after a YC partner told us: founders at B2B companies are experts at their jobs, but consistently struggle to turn that expertise into marketing that drives revenue.\r\n\r\nWe launched in mid-July, now serve 40+ paying customers including 19 YC companies (Conduit W24, AthenaHQ W25, Bilanc W24, etc) plus VCs, global franchises, and ghostwriting agencies. Achieving minimum 30%-70% week to week growth.\r\n\r\n💡 Results:\r\n$10 M+ total revenue generated across clients\r\n$5 M deal closed from a single LinkedIn post\r\n$40 K inbound revenue in 1.5 weeks for one client\r\n200+ qualified inbounds in 1 month after hitting content-market fit\r\n\r\nWe’re not just another AI tool.\r\n\r\nWe’re forward-deployed content engineers, building the content OS for every LinkedIn-native B2B company.\r\n\r\n📅 Book a demo: https://calendar.notion.so/meet/skyyang333/ghost\r\n\r\n🔗 Connect with Sky: https://www.linkedin.com/in/skyyang/",

For developers, this means onboarding onto complex codebases faster. For AI agents, it means getting the necessary code context to minimize hallucinations and maximize cohesion within the wider codebase.\r\n\r\nSourcebot solves this by giving developers and AI agents the ability to regex search across millions of lines of code instantly, as well as ask questions across thousands of repos using any flagship reasoning model. Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe met a decade ago at McGill University and have been building together full time for over 2 years.

    "long_description": "Airports are among the most data-rich yet information-poor environments in transportation. Thousands of radio transmissions, aircraft movements, and sensor signals occur every second, but these systems remain siloed. Most airfields still rely on manual logs and calls to understand what’s happening on the ground, creating blind spots that slow coordination and limit safety oversight.\r\n\r\nThe result is a growing safety and efficiency gap. The FAA records four to five runway incursions every day, and over 90% of air traffic control facilities are operating below target staffing levels. Despite $20 billion in modernization programs like NextGen and Safety Management Systems, airports still lack a unified data backbone that connects communication, movement, and intent across the airfield.\r\n\r\nStratus provides the missing layer of intelligence for airport and airside operations — unifying data, communication, and movement into one shared, real-time picture.\r\n\r\nFor airports, this means faster decisions, clearer accountability, and safer, more efficient operations.\r\nFor aviation as a whole, it’s the foundation for connected, data-driven infrastructure that can finally keep pace with modern airside complexity.",

Our system enables voice agents, copilots, and chat interfaces to retrieve, reason, and respond in sub-10 ms, delivering the responsiveness that makes AI interactions feel truly natural.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever built a conversational or voice AI product, you’ve felt the lag. That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding. Moss is already powering production pilots across voice AI and developer platforms, achieving sub-10 ms retrieval and 70–90% token savings compared to traditional pipelines.",
