SparkGift supports small dollar gifts and fractional shares, so you can give someone a $20 investment in Apple or a Vanguard index fund.\r\n\r\nSparkGift is creating products that make investing simple, enjoyable and accessible to the masses.  Our mission is to use gifts to create new savers & investors at scale.",
