  "long_description": "Shasqi is leading the development of therapeutics leveraging click chemistry to get active cancer treatments to tumors with its proprietary CAPACâ„¢ platform. Our technology is based on localizing a click chemistry reagent in the tumor area, which then activates a second agent, a systemically infused protodrug. When the two 'click', a powerful localized therapy is activated at the tumor, while keeping its systemic exposure levels below toxic thresholds.",
