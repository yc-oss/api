  "long_description": "GiveMeTap is a social enterprise. Our mission is to make clean drinking water available to everyone, everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe create stainless steel water bottles, and each bottle funds 5 years of clean water for someone in Africa. When you get a GiveMeTap bottle, you also have access to the free-water network of cafes and shops who give free tap water to people on the go. No questions, no hassle.\r\n\r\nWe build water projects in remote villages and elect a water committee to run the maintenance of the water. So far we have made an impact in Namibia, Malawi, and Ghana to bring clean water for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe like to think of this as ‘Water for You, Water for Everyone’.\r\n\r\nWe help awesome companies create custom bottles for their staff, customers, and events so that they can stay hydrated, reduce plastic waste and help fund water projects. Our partners include:\r\n\r\nDeloitte\r\nHSBC\r\nYCombinator\r\nGoogle\r\nTED\r\nFlexport\r\nLegal & General\r\nRichard Branson's The Lodge, Switzerland\r\nCambridge University \r\n\r\nWant to get your company involved?
