  "long_description": "NudgePad is an IDE for prototyping in your browser. It allows anyone to launch a fully hosted custom app in two seconds. \r\n\r\nNudgePad removes all the pain and complication of starting a project, including server setup, deploying, cloning, version control, SSL, DNS, and API integrations. Whatâ€™s left is an expandable suite of creative tools that make it easy to design and deploy an app in minutes. \r\n\r\nEvery app created in NudgePad is also a template. Designers and copywriters can use a template with back and front-end functionality to edit content without writing a line of code.\r\n\r\nAs the suite of tools grow, NudgePad will help scale prototypes into finished products.",
