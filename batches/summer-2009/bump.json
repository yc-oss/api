  "long_description": "Bump was acquired by Google in 2013.  The Bump and Flock apps were shut down, but our unreleased Photoroll app went on to become the basis for Google Photos, which we led from inception to more than 1B users.\r\n\r\nBump let you exchange contact info and photos by bumping phones together.  Bump was one of the all-time top mobile apps, amassing more than 150M installs by 2013.  Flock was a semi-automated photo sharing app that figured out which photos you took with which friends and created private shared albums.\r\n\r\nBump was co-founded in 2009 and received funding from Y Combinator, Sequoia, and Andreessen-Horowitz. We were based in Mountain View, CA.",
