  "long_description": "Capitol builds intelligence infrastructure for companies overwhelmed by data but starved for clarity. Today, 80% of enterprise AI projects fail because outputs aren't accurate, attributable, or usable. Capitol AI works with companies in high-stakes industries to turn information into intelligence that drives decisions with model-agnostic, purpose-built infrastructure. \r\n\r\nCapitol is building a different future - one where institutions, creators, and analysts stay in control of their knowledge, their IP, and their value. We deliver a model-agnostic platform that turns complexity into decision-grade insight. We don't believe the future should be dictated by a handful of closed models. We enforce attribution, minimize hallucinations, and preserve temporal accuracy - giving companies trusted answers they can act on.",
