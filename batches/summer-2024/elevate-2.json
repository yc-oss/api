  "long_description": "Elevate is a platform for roll-ups to overcome the data challenges that cripple acquisitions and block access to the latest AI technology. We handle hair-on-fire data migrations, provide a centralized repository for cross-portfolio data aggregation, diligence, and analytics, and enable our customers to quickly access and experiment with the latest agentic AI solutions. \r\n\r\nOur experience is at the intersection of finance x tech. As a VP in Private Equity, Scott Cara, the CEO of Elevate, experienced data challenges first-hand and through his vast network of private equity investors and operators. Jeff (CPO) and Steve (CTO) are experienced software engineers with decorated backgrounds in data, finance, and start-ups. The founding team has been friends for every a decade. \r\n\r\nOur customers are private equity-backed roll-ups. Roll-ups have become an increasingly popular value creation strategy in private equity as $0.5T+ of dry powder intersects with a wave of baby boomer retirements. But roll-ups need to be integrated to realize synergies. That’s where Elevate comes in – we enable our roll-up customers to realize synergies faster through data integrations and AI automations, allowing the team to focus on deal-making and growth. ",
