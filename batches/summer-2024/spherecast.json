  "long_description": "Spherecast is building Agnes, the AI Supply Chain Manager for Consumer Goods. \r\n\r\nAgnes decides what to produce, where to make it, and how to move it through factories, warehouses, and channels – simulating thousands of options in seconds and executing the best plan.\r\n\r\nWe are building Agnes to shape the physical flow of goods in the world, turning it into something as programmable as code.\r\n\r\nWhen we succeed, every consumer product you touch will run on the Spherecast stack – planned in the Spherecast OS, executed over Spherecast Rails, and optimized by the shared Spherecast Network.\r\n\r\nOracle turned atoms into bits.\r\nSpherecast turns bits back to atoms, but globally optimized.\r\n\r\nBe part of the next $T company.",
