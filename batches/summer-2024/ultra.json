  "long_description": "Ultra builds practical, general-purpose robots that are deploying—and producing ROI—today.\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional industrial automation that’s rigid and complex, our robots are zero integration (able to be installed in hours, not weeks) and are highly flexible, capable of quickly learning new tasks and delivering immediate value to customers.\r\n\r\nFounded by a team of three-time entrepreneurs with a decade of collaboration, Ultra moves fast. We already have robots in the field generating revenue and data, with plans to rapidly scale deployments this year.",
