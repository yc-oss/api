  "long_description": "Anara is AI for scientific advancement. We help researchers find, understand and write scientific documents, together.\r\n\r\nWe started working on Anara two years ago. In that time:\r\n- we’ve grown to 3M users spanning hundreds of major colleges and research-led companies,\r\n- we are fast approaching $10M in yearly revenue,\r\n- 600M+ people have seen our content across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube,\r\n- and we raised $3M from YC and the founders of Github and Reddit.\r\n\r\nWe're a small, tight-knit team with huge ambitions. As a founding member, you'll be instrumental in helping us scale revenue from $10M to $100M and then $100M to $1B+.\r\n\r\nIf you’re excited by the idea of being a part of that, definitely reach out.",
