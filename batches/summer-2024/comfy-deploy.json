  "long_description": "ComfyUI is the most popular open-source framework to build media generation workflows. However, it's a single-player experience that needs to run on a local GPU. Everyone has different environments and sharing workflows to someone else can take days to get setup.\r\n\r\nComfy Deploy fixes this by creating a collaborative workspace, where a teams environemnt, models and workflows can be shared as easily with a link.\r\n\r\n**Team ComfyUI workspace**\r\n\r\n• Replacing cobbled-together solutions with a unified, team-focused environment. When it works for you, you can be sure it works for your team.\r\n\r\n• Eliminate \"works on my machine\" issues with version control.\r\n\r\n• Share storage for models and outputs.\r\n\r\n• Leverage the power of ComfyUI without the complexities of self-hosting\r\n\r\n**Powerful GPU Infrastructure**\r\n• Access managed GPUs that grow with your teams needs\r\n\r\n• Tailor the platform to your requirements by easily installing custom nodes and models\r\n\r\n\r\n**Custom configuration**\r\n\r\n• Download the models you want, stored privately in your personal volume\r\n\r\n• Install the custom nodes your workflow needs\r\n\r\n• Train models on your own datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n**API Deployments: From workflow to production in seconds**\r\n\r\n• Transform any workflow into a fully functional API immediately without extra engineering\r\n\r\n• Comprehensive observability on every run\r\n\r\n• Built-in API authentication\r\n\r\n• TS/JS/Python/Ruby SDKs for seamless integration\r\n",
