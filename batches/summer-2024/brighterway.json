  "long_description": "At Brighterway, we use AI to speed up the medical record review process in the Workers' Compensation Industry. Physicians and claims handlers spend hours reviewing thousands of pages of medical documents– our technology highlights the information that is most relevant to a doctor's specialty or a given injury, streamlining their review process and saving them time.\r\n\r\nBrighterway structures and deduplicates disorganized medical records (PDFs) and extracts the content that is medically relevant and related to a given claim, so they can focus on what matters most.",
