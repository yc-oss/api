  "long_description": "Digitalcarbon transforms ordinary images and videos into interactive, photorealistic 3D environments. Our technology can take photos from any device and render 3D scenes at more than 100 frames per second on everyday devices. \r\n\r\nThe founders were the first and second hires at a previous YC company AssemblyAI, and have more than 8 years of experience building AI models. \r\n\r\nCreating immersive 3D experiences typically requires complex equipment and suffers from slow rendering speeds. This has limited the adoption of 3D technology across various industries. Digitalcarbon fixes that, eliminating the need for specialized equipment and dramatically accelerating the rendering process.\r\n\r\nOur technology enables applications across various industries:\r\n* Real estate: Creating virtual property tours that feel remarkably lifelike\r\n* E-commerce: Providing interactive 3D product visualizations to boost consumer experience\r\n* Tourism: Helping tourist businesses attract more travelers with immersive virtual previews\r\n* Drone mapping and inspection: Enhancing aerial surveys and structural assessments with detailed 3D models\r\n\r\nThink Unreal Engine meets Matterport with no hardware, but faster, editable, and more accessible for businesses of all sizes.",
