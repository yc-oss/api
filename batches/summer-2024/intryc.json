  "long_description": "Consumer enterprises have millions of customer support tickets annually. They need to constantly evaluate support agents’ performance and compliance. Typically they evaluate less than 5% of those interactions manually which is slow, expensive and not scalable. Intryc's AI can evaluate 100% of all customer interactions, in real time, at half the cost.\r\n",
