  "long_description": "DreamRP lets users chat with character chatbots made by the content owners themselves. For example, users could chat with Jon Snow bot made by George R. R. Martin. \r\n\r\nCharacter chat is the most engaging social category ever - more than YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok. But all the current chatbots are fan-made knock-offs and do not have deals with the actual content owners, whose IP they are stealing.  Weâ€™re building the first fully legal character chat platform that shares revenue with the content owners.",
