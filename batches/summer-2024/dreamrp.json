  "long_description": "AI entertainment feels like slop because companies chose technology over human creativity.\r\n\r\nCompanies like to focus on tech because it usually lets them win. But what fans love has never been about the tech.\r\n\r\nA fan doesn’t fill their apartment with posters because of the lens a movie was shot on. They do it because of the mind behind the camera.\r\n\r\nLike all technology, AI is just a tool. In the wrong hands, it makes endless sludge. In the right ones, fans will love entertainment more than ever.\r\n\r\nDreamRP builds for creatives, from indie artists to global stars, because they have always been the real reason audiences love what they love.\r\n\r\nIf this resonates, message me.\r\n\r\nEthics FAQ on website in bio\r\n\r\n",
