  "long_description": "BeeBettor makes sports betting simple. Currently, sports bettors download more than 40 sports betting apps to get the full experience. At each one, they must go through a long KYC process. Then once their 40 accounts are active and funded, finding the best price is a painstaking process involving third-party tools to search available offers. BeeBettor aggregates all these accounts into one app and automatically gives sports bettors the best price.",
