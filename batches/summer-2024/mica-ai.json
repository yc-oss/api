  "long_description": "Mica's AI agents replace the data ops teams fixing bad data.\r\n\r\nWhen bad or missing data breaks the pipeline, and orchestration, retries, and monitoring fail, painful manual review work kicks in, pulling humans in to investigate and patch data issues across systems. Mica does what those humans do: gathering the right information from internal docs and external systems, reasoning across context, and resolving errors autonomously to get the pipeline moving again.\r\n\r\nThe result: dramatically reduce time, cost, and operational drag as your data pipelines scale without scaling ops headcount. Mica turns judgment-heavy data fixes from a manual bottleneck into an automated background process with full auditability.\r\n",
