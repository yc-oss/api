  "long_description": "Mica is a no-code AI Agent builder that turns plain-English prompts into enterprise quality AI agents. Just describe your agent:\r\n“Every morning, pull in pricing data from our data lake. I want you to take this data and run a report every morning on price movements broken down by brand and retailer and email this report to the relevant stakeholders every morning. Also upload the data into our datavis platform and send me a slack message once you do.”\r\n\r\nMica instantly builds a live agent that:\r\n\r\n1. Connects to your apps (OAuth, APIs, auth flows)\r\n2. Runs multi-step automations continuously\r\n3. Improves and changes behavior in real-time with simple instructions in English\r\n4. No need to mess around with drag and drop UIs or add complicated chains or rules\r\n\r\nIn short: no coding, no convoluted setup, just results.",
