  "long_description": "Starcloud is building data centers in space, initially to provide GPU compute to other satellites, and later to address the rapidly growing demand for energy caused by the deployment of AI. Falling launch costs give Starcloud access to abundant energy, radiative cooling, and the ability to rapidly scale in space.\r\n\r\nIn November 2025, just 21 months after founding, Starcloud launched its first satellite, Starcloud-1 to space. This has an Nvidia H100, which is 100x more powerful GPU than has ever been operated in space before. With this, they became the first entity to train an LLM in space and the first to run a version of Gemini in space. \r\n\r\nStarcloud are launching their second satellite in October this year, which will have 100x the power generation of the first. Starcloud expects that within 10 years, most new data centers will be being built in space for the energy.",
