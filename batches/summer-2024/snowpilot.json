  "long_description": "Snowpilot combines a spreadsheet UI with a federated data engine. We get live data from tools like Salesforce, Gong, and Mixpanel, enabling PMs, marketers, and salespeople to run high-impact workflows with data at any scale.\r\n\r\nBen and Dom met at a Sequoia & a16z-backed data startup, Census. Together, we built the first real-time, warehouse-native customer data platform. Prior to that, Dom led 20+ ML engineers at Adobe to build their internal ad optimization platform, which allocates $1B in annual spend. Ben built the microservices stack powering the new Microsoft Edge, scaling from 0 to hundreds of millions of DAUs.\r\n\r\nWe started coding Snowpilot in mid-August '24, and we already have a live app that can run sub-second queries on millions of rows, entirely in the user's browser.\r\n\r\nThe data warehouse market is $10B/yr, growing 23% YOY. We will disrupt incumbents and significantly expand this market by enabling non-engineers to use big data on a daily basis.",
