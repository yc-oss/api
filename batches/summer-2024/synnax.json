  "long_description": "We build software that helps hardware teams quickly and clearly evaluate how a component (engine, battery, valve, etc.) or process (assembly line, manufacturing plant) performs. We prevent mistakes, reduce costs, and accelerate time-to-market. Our platform unifies industrial control with sensor data storage and automated post-processing, delivering an end-to-end operations and observability stack. To put it comparatively, take LabVIEW, InfluxDB, and Grafana, wrap them into a single package, add a bit of magic, and you get Synnax.",
