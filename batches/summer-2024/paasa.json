  "long_description": "Paasa helps wealthy Indians invest in global equities - without middlemen, hidden fees, or paperwork.\r\n\r\nWhile high-net-worths in India often have international expenses from children's education to healthcare, most still save in INR, a currency that depreciates ~2â€“5% per year against the USD. Why?\r\n- Broken outward remittance process\r\n- Fear of making mistakes in tax or compliance\r\n- Paper-heavy onboarding processes of international brokers\r\n- Lack of trustworthy guidance\r\n\r\nPaasa offers a mobile app that enables Indians to trade worldwide, invest passively, and automate every cross-border tax filing.",
