  "long_description": "Cheers is the control center for your frontline brand, answering three critical questions:\r\n1. What are customers actually experiencing?\r\n2. Who is creating those experiences?\r\n3. How do we scale what works?\r\n\r\nMost tools stop at “what.” Without “who,” “how” is guesswork.\r\n\r\nOur AI-powered platform creates the first real-time dataset that attributes online reviews, social mentions, loyalty sign-ups, and NPS surveys directly to individual frontline employees. Instead of vague aggregate reports, managers get clear, actionable insights: who to coach, who to recognize, and which actions actually work.\r\n\r\nAs AI-driven search and agents weigh every public signal, your brand narrative is critical. Cheers monitors and attributes those signals so you can engineer the experiences AI recommends.\r\n\r\nVivint Smart Home identified top performers and generated 60,000+ new five-star reviews in five months across 400 locations.
