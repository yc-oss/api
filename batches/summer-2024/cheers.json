  "long_description": "Cheers magnifies customer-employee interactions by streamlining review generation, loyalty sign-ups, app downloads, and tipping â€”all of which is instantly attributed to specific employees, teams, locations, and regions. This matters because many companies struggle to measure individual frontline performance, making it difficult to optimize customer experiences. Without buy-in from the frontline, corporate transformations fail 97% of the time (McKinsey).\r\n\r\nOur AI-native platform uses NFC employee badges and AI agents to turn customer interactions into measurable data, unlocking the first real-time performance dataset for frontline workers.\r\n\r\nManagers gain instant insights into who's successfully driving corporate initiatives, enabling them to answer questions like: \"Who's driving the most positive reviews?\", \"Which employees get the most loyalty sign-ups?\", and \"Where will coaching will deliver the most impact?\" Vivint used Cheers to track and incentivize frontline sales staff for positive customer interactions. As a result, workers amassed 50,000+ five-star reviews in just 4 months, skyrocketing their Google rating from 2.0 to 4.9 stars across 400 locations.\r\n\r\nCheers empowers your frontline to be as data-driven, measurable, and optimizable as your digital channels.",
