  "long_description": "Frontline labor is the largest operating expense for millions of businesses (retail, home services, hospitality) and the direct source of their reputation. Yet, most companies lack granular attribution between employee actions and customer outcomes like reviews, loyalty, or revenue.\r\n\r\nCheers solves this by building a proprietary dataset linking every customer signal to the individual responsible. This allows our platform to identify revenue-driving behaviors and automate the coaching and incentives to scale them.\r\n\r\nThis is now critical. As AI agents increasingly use online signals to decide which brands to recommend, reputation becomes the primary driver behind purchasing decisions. Cheers enables businesses to engineer the training data at the source, turning unmeasured labor into a quantifiable growth engine.",
