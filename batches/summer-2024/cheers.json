  "long_description": "AI assistants are rapidly becoming the way customers find local services. When someone asks ChatGPT for a plumber, AI recommends based on reputation, not ads. Winning this new channel requires optimizing reviews, citations, and social proof across dozens of platforms. This is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).\r\n\r\nCheers is the GEO platform for service businesses. We analyze your online reputation, build a custom optimization strategy, then turn your frontline employees into a reputation engine with mobile tools that capture reviews & goodwill at the point of service. Everything is tied to the individual, so you see which employees and locations drive outcomes, and you can coach, reward, and scale what works.\r\n\r\nVivint Smart Home generated 70,000 reviews in 5 months with Cheers and now leads when customers ask AI for smart home services in their market.
