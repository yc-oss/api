  "long_description": "Cheers is the control center for your frontline brand, answering three critical questions:\r\n1. What's our reputation?\r\n2. Who's driving it?\r\n3. How do we improve it?\r\n\r\nCurrent tools answer #1. Nobody answers #2. Without #2, you can't do #3.\r\n\r\nOur AI-powered platform creates the first real-time dataset that attributes online reviews, social mentions, loyalty sign-ups, and NPS surveys directly to individual frontline employees. Instead of vague reports, managers receive clear, actionable insights: which employees need coaching, who deserves recognition, and how to elevate customer experience.\r\n\r\nVivint Smart Home used our platform to identify and reward their top performers, resulting in 60,000+ new five-star reviews in five months across 400 locations.\r\n\r\nTake control of your frontline brand with Cheers.
