  "long_description": "Corporate transformations that fail to engage frontline employees succeed only 3% of the time (McKinsey), because companies lack visibility into individual performance -- making it impossible to optimize the customer experience.\r\n\r\nCheers changes that. Our AI-native platform leverages NFC employee badges and AI agents to transform every employee interaction into measurable data: customers tap to leave reviews, join loyalty programs, download apps, or tip, with each action instantly attributed to the employee responsible.\r\n\r\nThis unlocks the first real-time performance dataset for frontline workers. Managers gain instant insights into who drives 3x more app downloads, which shifts convert highest, and precisely where coaching delivers impact. Vivint powered by Cheers amassed 50,000+ five-star reviews in just 4 months, skyrocketing their Google rating from 2.0 to 4.9 stars.\r\n\r\nCheers empowers your frontline to be as data-driven, measurable, and optimizable as your digital channels.",
