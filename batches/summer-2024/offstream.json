  "long_description": "Offstream is Vanta for carbon compliance. \r\n\r\nToday, every new infrastructure project, from data centers to biomass power plants has a complicated mess of local, state, federal, and private sector standards that they must understand and comply with to make their projects profitable.\r\n\r\nOffstream solves this by using LLMs to parse regulations, generate technical reports for customers, and manage 100,000+ operational data points on projectâ€™s lifecycles. We cut the time customers spend on compliance by 90% and at 1/5th of the cost of alternatives.",
