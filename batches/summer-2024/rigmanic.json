  "long_description": "We build humanoid home robots powered by artificial muscles. Compared to motor-driven robots, ours are lighter, softer, safer, and stronger for their weight. Richard dropped out of medicine at Oxford and Chenny left her Oxford PhD in computer science to build the full stackâ€”from custom actuators to embodied AI. We went from zero hardware experience to a full humanoid prototype in just 2 months.",
