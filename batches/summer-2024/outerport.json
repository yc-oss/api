  "long_description": "Outerport helps convert proprietary visual data- every diagram, drawing, webpages, documents, CAD files and more into an exact text representation that can be ingested by LLMs and re-rendered back. For example, flowcharts are notoriously common in enterprise documents and are used to describe mission critical business processes. Instead of relying on faulty VLMs to understand these properly, Outerport converts this into an text-based graph object that can be reliably parsed by LLMs and are easier to debug / run evals when there are issues.
