Think of it as an LLM-powered feed delivering you useful content in short insights.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you’re building an AI voice agent, you’ll see the latest in speech-to-text models without having to actively search, go through a pile of research papers, or prompt an LLM.\r\n\r\nWe extract key takeaways from long-form content - allowing you to read as little or as much as you like from the original piece of information. With et al., you get to stay on top of breakthroughs in your field, build knowledge, and discover new interests effortlessly.",
