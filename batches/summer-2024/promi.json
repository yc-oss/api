  "long_description": "Promi is an AI-powered price and discount optimization platform. We help eCommerce merchants personalize their sales to generate additional revenue and profit.\r\n\r\nEcommerce merchants and marketers typically use discounts to drive customer acquisition, boost sales during holidays, or liquidate inventory. But deciding on a discount to offer is typically guesswork. Who to send the discount to, how much to offer, and which products it applies to are, in the most advanced cases, determined manually by looking at past sales and seeing what worked well. In the majority of cases, it's what feels and sounds good.\r\n\r\nPromi leverages store data to optimize discounts at a more granular level than possible manually. We dynamically determine the best value across each product, for different users, at different times in order to maximize sales and profit.",
