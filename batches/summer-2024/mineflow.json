  "long_description": "Mineflow is an AI platform for mineral exploration. We generate predictions for mineral deposit shapes and locations, empowering mining companies from initial exploration to advanced feasibility studies.\r\n\r\nGeologists need to know precisely where their deposits are because drilling is expensive. In early trials with a lithium mining company, we found that Mineflow predicts the shape of hard rock lithium deposits more than an order of magnitude more accurately than our competitors.\r\n\r\nRyan received a BS in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science where he helped teach both the grad-level Deep Learning course and the grad-level Search Engines course. He built ML models at Google in the Display Ads optimization org for 2 years and launched products that generated ~125m USD in ARR.",
