  "long_description": "FINNY is building a new operating system for independent financial advisors, and starting by helping them grow.\r\n \r\nOur goal is to empower the best financial advisors (the independents!) to serve all Americans who want financial advice.  We are starting with growth, which is the most existential problem advisors face. \r\n                                                                                                                                                      \r\nThe organic growth process is highly inefficient and full of noise. Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.  \r\n\r\nAt FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:\r\n- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead\r\n- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair\r\n- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects\r\n\r\nIn essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",
