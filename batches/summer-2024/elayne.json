  "long_description": "Elayne helps families organize their assets, estate documents, and key contacts in one place, then guides them through life transitions as circumstances and priorities evolve. Like getting married, moving, having a baby, or losing a parent.\r\nUnlike traditional wealth management tools or online estate platforms that produce static legal documents, Elayne is dynamic, intelligent, and built not just to delight, but to comfort and guide you when it matters most.\r\n\r\nI started Elayne after my mom passed away and I had to settle her estate, accounts, and affairs - essentially, I suddenly had to untangle all the details of her life. It was shocking how fragmented and opaque the process was and how I spent hundreds of hours chasing documents, coordinating accounts, filling legal gaps, and navigating unfamiliar systems, all while grieving and working full time. It shouldn’t be that way.\r\n\r\nIn the future, you could hire an attorney, download DIY legal forms, fax and mail physical documents, sync 10 different fintech apps, use a financial planner, spend thousands in fees, and hope it all holds together. Or, you could just use Elayne.",
