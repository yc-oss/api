  "long_description": "We enable research that was previously impossible—systematic reviews of 20,000+ papers in weeks with 98% accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe collaborate with researchers at Stanford, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins to ask the big questions they've been forced to scale down.\r\n\r\nPharma companies get complete evidence awareness in weeks — not years.\r\n\r\nAI labs get the same reviews as RL environments with expert-validated reasoning traces—scientific synthesis as the next frontier after math and coding benchmarks. \r\n\r\nWe're former DSPy core contributors who built the production infrastructure to make total evidence awareness actually work at scale.",
