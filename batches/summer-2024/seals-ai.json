  "long_description": "Seals is a suite of AI Employees for Wholesalers & Distributors. Instead of relying on humans to quote, take orders, collect payments, place purchase orders and enter data into ERPs. We build AI Employees that do these manual repetitive tasks for the 700k wholesalers in the US.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™re a team of three Computer Science majors, and Fernando launched and grew AT&T in Mexico to $120M ARR. Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\r\n\r\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.\r\n",
