  "long_description": "Proxis is the AI automation platform built for enterprises.\r\n\r\nProxis is creating AI email agents that empower brands and enterprise teams to close deals automatically. Think: your inbox, on autopilot.\r\n\r\nWe initially fine tuned and distilled LLMs for enterprise use—and quickly realized that companies need more than just smarter models. They need full-stack automation. So Proxis built AI agents that handle the tedious, time-consuming work—everything from autonomous sales closers to customer service agents.\r\n\r\nThe mission is bold: to build the world’s most capable team of AI agents for every enterprise. Proxis imagines a future where a single founder can run a billion-dollar company—backed by a custom-built army of agents. Proxis is rethinking how agents are built, trained, and deployed from the ground up.",
