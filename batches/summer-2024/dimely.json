  "long_description": "Dimely helps accounting teams scale their order management & contract review workflows. Today fast-growing tech unicorns like Checkr and Airbyte get more coverage with less manual work by using Dimely’s AI agents to intelligently extract relevant details from core files like Order Forms, MSAs & POs, flag discrepancies, and then sync this information to core finance systems like NetSuite and Stripe.\r\n\r\nDimely leverages what finance and accounting teams love most, spreadsheets, for all its workflows so teams never feel out of place. Teams just replace their existing, siloed Excel spreadsheet with one that's connected and powered by AI. Teams love Dimely for its ease of use and intuitive user experience that saves them hundreds if not thousands of hours a month. ",
