  "long_description": "Better Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication solution for TypeScript that lets you implement everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems directly on your own database, embedded in your backend. We’re obsessed with making it ridiculously easy to roll your own auth, so you never have a reason not to. It’s loved by developers and endorsed by leading voices in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOn top of the framework, Better Auth also provides an infrastructure layer for the things that aren’t practical to ship as a library like user management and analytics, bot and fraud detection, transactional email and SMS, global session storage, and tailored support and advisory for your specific Better Auth setup.",
