  "long_description": "YouLearn is an AI tutor personalized to each student. It turns your learning materials into concise notes, an AI tutor you can talk to, and personalized tests.\r\n\r\nIn the last eight months, we’ve grown from $1K to $65K MRR, and over 150,000 students use YouLearn each month.\r\n\r\nAchyut, Soami, and David have known each other for the past two and a half years, having started building projects in their dorms. Soami interned at Groq, Achyut built six AI apps in one summer, and David grew an audience of over 200M views on Instagram and TikTok.\r\n\r\nAs recent college dropouts, we saw daily how students learn with AI and where current tools fall short. We believe every student will have a personal AI tutor, and we’re building the one you’ll never want to skip class on.",
