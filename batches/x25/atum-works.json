  "long_description": "Atum Works is building 3D ASML.\r\n\r\nThe world is hooked on chips, thanks to the power of lithography.\r\nBut, 2D lithography resolution has maxed out: Moore's law is dead.\r\nTo move forward, we must transition to a 3D manufacturing process whose cost scales with materials, not layers. \r\n\r\nAtum Works is building the world's most advanced 3D lithography process to 3D print parts >10,000x cheaper in low-volume and 10x cheaper in mass-manufacturing compared to today's 2D lithography. \r\n\r\nSince starting YC, we have built a printer, and partnered with NVIDIA. \r\nWe are shipping products this year. \r\n\r\nFounded by Caltech and NASA engineers, we're starting the next scaling law of semiconductor manufacturing, this time in 3D.",
