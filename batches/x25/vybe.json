  "long_description": "Vybe turns a simple chat prompt into a production-ready internal app. You connect your systems—Workday, Jira, Github, Salesforce, Snowflake, Slack—and the platform instantly generates the UI, backend, secure data pipelines, and role-based access control, then keeps everything up-to-date as your needs evolve. Built-in AI agents take care of repetitive follow-ups and status pings, so the tools you launch actually stay used.\r\n\r\nBeyond code, Vybe ships proven playbooks. We partner with top engineering, product, and ops leaders—capturing how they run one-on-ones, all-hands, onboarding, and more—then release those workflows as plug-and-play templates you can adopt in a click. The result is a living system of bespoke apps plus best-practice processes that scales with your company from day one.",
