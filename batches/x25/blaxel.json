  "long_description": "Blaxel is a cloud infrastructure to power AI agents. Our platform gives AI companies the toolbox and infrastructure to build and deploy agents efficiently. \r\n\r\nBillions of agents, tools, and models will transform how we work in the coming years. Traditional cloud providers weren't designed to handle them—their one-size-fits-all architecture holds them back. We fixed that with Blaxel.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? A complete computing platform with:\r\n\r\n- all services for developers to fast-track deploying agents without reinventing the wheel — like framework-agnostic serverless deployments, an AI gateway for model routing and fallback, and custom MCP server hosting.\r\n- a flexible low-level API for builders to ship really performant agentic AI using our backbone infrastructure — using services like sandboxed VMs usable by agents, a programmable global gateway, and a 20ms-latency serverless compute engine.\r\n- and a seamless developper experience that integrates with their CI/CD, and APIs that can even be consumed by agents themselves!",
