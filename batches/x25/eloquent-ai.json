  "long_description": "Eloquent AI empowers regulated industries to confidently deploy AI agents for critical, high-stakes conversations.\r\n\r\nWe developed the first Agentic OS that leverages deep evaluations and reinforcement learning to eliminate hallucinations and errors. Our agents autonomously ingest knowledge, measure performance, and self-correct by refining internal reward models.\r\n\r\nAt the core of our technology is the Mission Control Engine, specifically designed for reliability and compliance:\r\n- User simulations for pre-launch assurance of agent performance.\r\n- Contextual compliance, with AI models trained directly on mandated regulations, eliminating liabilities from unauthorized advice or mishandled complaints.\r\n- Comprehensive audit trails that document and clearly explain AI decision-making to regulators.\r\n\r\nBuilt for compliance and trust, Eloquent AI transforms AI from a potential liability into a strategic advantage for financial institutions and healthcare organizations.",
