    "long_description": "Fresh-produce supply chains are built around guesswork. Growers plant without clear demand signals, distributors overbuy to protect against shortages, and retailers end up eating the waste. GETASAP fixes this by rebuilding distribution around real demand and fast execution. We deliver wholesale fresh produce with 8-hour same-day delivery, using micro-fulfillment centers positioned close to demand so we can operate with far less safety stock.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, we look at live retail sales, purchasing, and waste patterns to decide what to source, where to place inventory, and when to replenish. That lets us buy closer to actual demand, turn inventory faster, and materially reduce spoilage. For retailers, GETASAP replaces procurement teams and fragmented supplier management—we handle sourcing, inventory decisions, and fulfillment end to end as a single, reliable partner. As more volume flows through the network, demand becomes clearer, sourcing gets smarter, and the operation becomes cheaper and more predictable over time.",

A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our self-guided missile platform is man-portable and multi-domain capable. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement over existing kinetic solutions. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued their PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nJason and Steve used more than 100 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. In 8 short weeks following a strict 2-week design-build-test cycle, the team has gone through 4 major guided missile iterations with over 30 live-fire flight tests. They were invited to Ft. Hood to present their platform to the 1st Cavalry Division, and also briefed the Pentagon and U.S. congressmen on current U.S. vulnerabilities to advanced drone technology.  Perseus Defense is actively standing up cooperative research agreements with U.S. Army DEVCOM's Applied Research Laboratory, Aviation and Missile Center, Armaments Center, and High Performance Computing Modernization Program.

Our platform integrates directly into existing university systems (SIS, LMS, CRM), learns each institution’s unique workflows, and deploys specialized AI agents. This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.\r\n\r\nSadia previously built Salesforce’s Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.\r\n\r\nDanial was one of DoorDash’s earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale. \r\n\r\nShahryar was a GM at Airwallex, where he built the entire Americas business from 0 to 1 and drove 11x revenue growth.  He’s also a master closer, single-handedly securing over $17M in enterprise deals at NerdWallet.  He’s a relentless startup executor with deep expertise launching and scaling go-to-market machines in highly regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe launched six weeks ago and are already at $8k MRR, growing 55% week-over-week -- one of the fastest ramps ever in higher ed. Universities urgently need solutions that expand labor capacity and efficiency, especially as they face unprecedented budget pressure and staffing shortages.\r\n\r\nWith unmatched buyer access, deep technical expertise, and rapid early traction, we are perfectly positioned to own this enormous market.",

Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution. ",

We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.\r\n\r\n✨ Try building an app at floot.com\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

    "long_description": "𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐰𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬:\r\nI (Angel) have had three knee surgeries since my mid-teens and was billed more than $250K for care that should have cost a fraction of that. Fighting those inflated charges was so painful that we set out to build a consumer-facing AI agent to do it for others. In less than five months, we helped sixty patients erase or reduce over $300K from their medical bills.\r\n\r\nThis inspired us to fix the problem farther upstream: stopping bad payments before the patient ever sees a bill. So we launched payment integrity, machine-learning models that audit every medical claim for self-insured employers and health plans in real time.\r\n\r\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:\r\n• Self-insured employers waste $60 B+ each year on claims that never should have been paid. Healthcare is the 2nd largest company expense after payroll.\r\n\r\n• Manual audits are slow and partial: Reviewers focus only on high-dollar claims, letting millions more slip through unnoticed.\r\n\r\n• Existing audit software is static: Decades-old rule engines can’t keep pace with evolving codes, contracts, or billing tactics.\r\n\r\n• Incentives are misaligned: Third-party administrators are paid to process claims, not to police them, so accuracy checks are minimal.\r\n\r\n𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:\r\nOur models audit medical claims before and after payments have been issued. We catch nuanced billing, coding, and contract errors to save 3-7% on annual claims spend. We work with self-insured employers and health plans.\r\n\r\n𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐔𝐬:\r\nAngel Onuoha (CEO) and Ahmad Shehu (CTO) have worked together for 4 years. Before Avelis Health they built Zuvy, a Lagos-based fintech company that provided invoice factoring to small businesses. Zuvy was acquired by The BAS Group in 2025.",

Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",

Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- “Certus changed my life overnight.”\r\n- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”\r\n-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”\r\n- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”\r\n-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

    "long_description": "stagewise builds an open-source frontend coding agent for real codebases. We enable backend devs, designers and product managers to build pretty and functional web apps in a simple and visually guided manner - no matter the used tech stack.\r\n\r\nstagewise lives right inside your browser, makes changes in your local codebase and is compatible with all kinds of frameworks and setups - allowing it to be retrofitted into any existing project. Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built.",

Mistakes run rampant, and each mistake is thousands of dollars. Even the select fleets using algorithms that have fleet-wide context struggle: the outputs are rigid, hard to interpret, and are blind to real-world nuances like driver preferences and schedule exceptions. Fleetline solves this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can easily adapt algorithms to each fleet’s needs and capture driver-specific information. The result is smarter planning truly optimized for every fleet and its drivers.",

    "long_description": "Magnetic scans client documents - from handwritten charity notes to excel spreadsheet Schedule Cs to multi-state K-1s - and enters them into tax software automatically, saving hours of tedious data entry. \r\n\r\nThe accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",

    "long_description": "We build Voice Models for regional languages (like Urdu, Bengali, Greek etc) and make them available through simple APIs and SDKs. \r\nDevelopers use us to create Voice-first digital experiences (eg. Voice eCommerce, Voice Banking, Voice AI Tutors etc).\r\n\r\nWe gather our own data, develop our own labelling tools, train our own models, and design our own voice infra. This fully integrated approach enables us to offer the best models and the best developer experience for regional languages.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPeople who would previously never use certain digital services (like online ordering), actually use the service when they are given an intuitive Voice based interface.\r\nWe believe that Voice Interfaces will onboard 100s of millions of new users onto digital services; and double the addressable market for technology companies. \r\nUplift AI will provide the best models to create these Voice Interfaces for 60% of the world's population that only speaks their regional language and represents 42 trillion dollars in GDP.\r\n",

On iPhone, a tiny USB-C plug-in (“Bud”) provides precise input control so Blue can act on your behalf. (Android support is in testing.)\r\n\r\nBlue is already in real-world use: people are clearing inboxes, paying bills from email, sharing files, and moving through routine flows while their hands are busy.\r\n\r\nThe team brings complementary experience at scale: Omar Abdelaziz led Google Assistant’s transition to LLMs and holds one of earliest patents in LLM-based computer control; Peter Krogh spent decades designing voice-first dialog systems and was most recently a design lead at Google DeepMind building actions for Gemini Live; Muhammad Farhan Hossain helped ship Apple Vision Pro, is named on dozens of hardware/systems patents, and has led products from prototype to mass production.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built systems used by billions.
