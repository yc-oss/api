Model labs and enterprises who want to improve these agents are bottlenecked by two resources: \r\n\r\n1) High quality datasets for benchmarking and evaluations\r\n2) Realistic sandbox environments for safe and accurate testing/training (ex. a simulated version of Salesforce) \r\n\r\nHalluminate offers a suite of products and services to address both these issues. \r\n\r\nOur evaluation service combines proprietary datasets with high quality annotations to help our customers identify and prioritize the biggest failure modes of their computer- and browser- use AI. \r\n\r\nOur platform provides a catalog of fully managed sandboxes, empowering our customers to safely and accurately test/train at scale, resulting in improved performance. \r\n\r\nOur customers see\r\n- Improved browser- and computer-use agent performance\r\n- New and emergent frontier agent capabilities\r\n- Data driven prioritization leading to exponentially faster development speed\r\n- Increased revenue/sales via marketing from public benchmarks\r\n\r\nOur paying customers already include leading computer use model labs and the two largest browser agent companies in the space. \r\n\r\nWyatt and Jerry are friends that met their first week of school studying CS at Cornell University.

Our micro-guided missile system is man-portable, multi-domain capable, and has both forward-deployed and low-collateral defeat variants. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued a PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nA UAS prototype was designed and built in one week and a prototype of the guided missile was prototyped in four days. Following the Stanford Hacking for Defense process that Perseus Defense adviser and former Army Ranger Dr. Jeff Decker wrote the book on, Jason and Steve used 60 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. Perseus has already been invited to a Phase-II in-person pitch of their solution to government end-users, signaling progress towards contract opportunities. ",

Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform that’s now being piloted by some of the largest agriculture and construction companies in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe are two German engineers who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With backgrounds in both enterprise engineering (Rheinmetall, dSPACE) and building web apps used by thousands, we have the unique blend of discipline and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to empower anyone to create well-designed applications, regardless of their technical skill. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built. stagewise will enable non-technical stakeholders - product managers, designers, and marketers - to directly iterate on the UI themselves, creating a new, collaborative workflow and making us the essential tool for building on the web.",

    "long_description": "Magnetic scans client documents - from handwritten charity notes to excel spreadsheet Schedule Cs to multi-state K-1s - and enters them into tax software automatically, saving hours of tedious data entry. \r\n\r\nThe accounting profession is facing a massive talent shortage, as graduates choose different professions and the old guard begins to retire. As a result, CPA and tax preparation firms are awash in clientele, but unable to keep up. At many firms, phones go unanswered, clients are \"fired\", and websites are taken down, as the existing workforce tries to handle the grueling 80 hour+ weeks necessary to push through tax season to the April 15th deadline.\r\n\r\nWe built this because a former colleague who owns her own tax firm asked us to automate her workload, and we quickly realized the massive opportunity. Thomas brings deep domain expertise as the former Head of Product at Keeper (YC W19), where he built tax engine automation systems and an OCR form scanning system that outperformed everything else on the market. At Keeper, he leveraged early access to OpenAI's LLMs (well before ChatGPT) to build systems that automated the entire tax filing process, allowing a tiny team of CPAs to process thousands of returns with near zero busy work. Patrick was the first engineer at FunCraft, shipping multiple mobile games with 1M+ downloads and building scalable shared codebases. We've worked together since 2017, including co-leading multiple teams at Zynga as PM & Tech Lead respectively.\r\n\r\nWe launched this year in the middle of tax season and quickly processed hundreds of returns, earning thousands in ARR, and since tax season we've been growing customers by >30% month-over-month. We've completely automated over 25% of the return process so far and developed a proprietary vision model that beats incumbent scanning technology by almost 2x on accuracy - jumping from 50% field-level accuracy to 89%, approaching the quality of their expensive human-verified service at 92%.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive - there are 80M US personal tax returns filed via professionals annually, in a $2B outsourcing market where individual CPA firms currently pay $100k-$1M per year for inferior services. We're positioned to capture significant market share by offering better accuracy & document coverage, instant processing, and superior user experience.\r\n\r\nWe've built this kind of software before, we've worked together for years (and even lived together), we've built products to $10M ARR before, and we have the grit to outwork anyone in this space.",
