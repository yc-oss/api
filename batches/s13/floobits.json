The two co-founders Matt Kaniaris and Geoff Greer used to pair program together while at Rackspace, and after leaving, they realized that they wanted to build something that could help others do the same.\n\nThe service offers freemium pricing, where free accounts have up to five workspaces available. But to work privately, a paid account starting at $15 per month is required.",
