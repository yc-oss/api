  "long_description": "IXI-Play is building a smart, Android-based robot for young children. They can play games with it; they’ll show the robot cards and it will mimic emotions on them. It sees, hears, speaks and moves.\r\n\r\nThe toy itself retails for $299 but it will also come with an app store and other accessories. It’s a hardware platform that can have customizable skins for different characters so it can either build its own IP or license out IP from other toy companies.",
