  "long_description": "Graft Concepts' approach is simple: create unique and iconic products through creative problem solving. They aim to create accessories with traits that pair elegantly with the device it's intended to enhance. Instead of creating iPhone cases that require brute force to install, their Leverage case was crafted with an elegant clasp that secures the case in place without distracting from the iPhone's original aesthetics. As a small and new company, they strive to innovate just beyond the familiar and create improvements that define new perspectives.\r\n\r\nThey are a small team that prides itself in providing a great customer experience to go along with a great product. Their products are designed in Southern California, engineered by the Swiss, and manufactured by hand picked factories to ensure high-quality standards.",
