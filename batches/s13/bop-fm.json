  "long_description": "bop.fm is a YCombinator-backed music technology company that creates a home for every song on the internet. The company aggregates several popular music services (Spotify, Rdio, iTunes, YouTube, SoundCloud, Deezer, etc.) into one interface. Users can then search for any song, play it using any service, and share/discover with any friend (even if they use a different service than you). bop.fm powers this same aggregation and service-agnostic music playback for Rap Genius, as well as music content publishers, messaging clients, social networks, artists/labels, and other partners.",
