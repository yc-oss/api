  "long_description": "Today's funders are so conservative they only fund the most obvious ideas. At Experiment, we fund the ideas that they won't fund; the ideas that matter.\r\n\r\nSince founding, over 47,000 citizens have pledged $9 million dollars supporting 900 scientific projects on the platform. 46% of all projects on Experiment are successfully funded. When the projects are finished, the scientists share the scientific results with their backers as lab notes and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nScientists from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale have chosen to use Experiment instead of writing grants. Bill Gates recognized Experiment by saying \"this solution helps close the gap for potentially-promising but unfunded projects.\"",
