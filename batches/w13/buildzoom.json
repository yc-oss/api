We connect homeowners to the most reliable general contractors in their area and make remodeling simpler, cheaper and more predictable.  \r\n\r\nOur technology harvests public data on every licensed contractor in the United States, including license information, building permits, bond and insurance information and other government records. We use this public data along with private data gleaned from past BuildZoom marketplace interactions to evaluate contractor quality, availability, and fit for each construction project. Our goal is to help project owners arrive at several competitive bids from highly qualified and experienced construction companies to ensure a fair price and a successful project.\r\n\r\nWe build tools to help contractors look their best online, manage their lead pipeline, seamlessly interact with project owners, and compose professional bid proposals.",
