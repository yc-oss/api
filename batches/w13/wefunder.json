  "long_description": "We help everyone invest in startups that they care about.\r\n\r\nWe believe that when all Americans can invest in innovation, the world will be a better place. And soon, our dream will become a reality. Thanks to the JOBS Act, everyone — not just the wealthy — can invest as little as $100 in the startups they care about. Not only does this open up the pool of investors, and increase the amount of great ideas that get funded, but it allows startups to grow an army of passionate investors who truly want to see them succeed. Second tier VC’s will become obsolete as startups tap their lead users and customers for quick early investments.",
