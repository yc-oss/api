  "long_description": "BackerKit is crowdfunding like you’ve never experienced—the only end-to-end platform built for today’s serious creators. \r\n\r\nBackerKit empowers creators to successfully manage and grow their crowdfunding campaigns. Since 2012, we've partnered with creators to build tools, such as the BackerKit Pledge Manager, that simplify campaign management for platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. In 2022, we launched our own crowdfunding platform, offering a seamless end-to-end solution for creators and backers alike. \r\n\r\nWe believe that it’s time that creators got more from crowdfunding—More fans. More funds. And waaay more fun. Keep a look out as the BackerKit team continues to innovate in the crowdfunding space: https://www.backerkit.com/for-creators",
