  "long_description": "Clever is a single platform for all of your digital learning programs. Founded in 2012, Clever was started by educators and technology professionals who knew that schools, teachers, and students could all benefit from the amazing learning software that was available, but key challenges stood in the way of accessing the technology. Today, half of K-12 schools in the U.S. use Clever to give students and teachers single sign-on access for any resource or file they need, and to automate software account setup and updates for district administrators. Clever gives teachers time to teach, helps districts be better informed, and makes using applications in the classroom effortless.\r\n\r\nWe are a team of more than 100 people passionate about education. If you feel the same way, you should see our openings at https://clever.com/about/jobs.",
