  "long_description": "Keychain Logistics is a software marketplace that directly connects companies shipping products with independent semi-truck owner-operators. Our platform effectively cuts out the traditional third-party logistics brokerage process by virtue of a software enabled network of virtual carriers (trucks on the go in our network). We understand where trucks in our network are at any given moment, their capacity, and if they would be an ideal match for a company shipping.",
