Filling a void in e-commerce, Celery has become the single-stop for innovative brands – large and small – to take pre-orders, crowdfund independently, and to continue selling before and after items are in-stock. Today, Celery has helped thousands of businesses launch their way by providing the tools to crowdfund and pre-sell independently.\n\nCelery is founded by a team crowdfunding and e-commerce experts and alums from MIT, Stanford, Groupon, LinkedIn and Foursquare, and is venture-backed by Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Elementum Ventures, Max Levchin, SV Angel, and other top investors.",
