  "long_description": "MicroEval will help you create modern, helpful performance reviews.\r\n\r\nIt’s the day of your annual performance review. You’re nervous, and rightfully so! After this meeting you’ll know whether or not you got that raise, if your work has been acceptable or if you should start looking for a new job. No one likes them. In fact, we didn’t even like them...that is until we decided that they didn’t have to be this way.\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn’t performance reviews be helpful? Why shouldn’t they help you improve and grow your skillset? Exactly what we thought.\r\n\r\nInspired by personal experiences, our team came together to help transform the performance review process into a worthwhile, meaningful and easy process.\r\n\r\nWho are we to take on this challenge you ask?",
