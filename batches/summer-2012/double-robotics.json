We help telecommuters feel more connected to their colleagues by giving them a physical presence wherever they need to be.\r\n\r\nHaving your own Double in the office means you can be free to roam around anywhere without scheduling a call or meeting. Double takes everything you love about video calls on an iPad and places that on a mobile base that puts the remote worker in control. By combining cutting edge technology with an intuitive, elegant design, Double is the ultimate tool for telecommuters. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to connect the world through remote experiences. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.doublerobotics.com\r\ninfo@doublerobotics.com",
