  "long_description": "Sepal AI works with the world’s leading experts for developing advanced capability training data, expert annotations, and bespoke model evaluations. \r\n\r\nOur team comes from Turing, Vercel, McKinsey, and Bain. At Turing, we built the LLM training business and products to support $100+M revenue for companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.\r\n\r\nWe learned that data development for advanced AI use cases is more complex and has unique needs different from traditional label generation \r\n\r\nFoundational AI companies and large enterprises that we worked with, like OpenAI, PepsiCo, and Johnson &Johnson, don't have the data they need to train models to produce value for highly technical use cases. Which means they’re not going to unlock the value from AI without a partner.\r\n\r\nWe are working with the most influential companies of our time to develop models and systems that extend human knowledge and capabilities.\r\n",
