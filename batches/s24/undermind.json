  "long_description": "At Undermind, we're building a search engine that can handle extremely complex questions. It’s geared at experts, like research scientists and doctors, who need to find very specific resources to solve high-stakes problems. \r\n\r\nWe’ve rebuilt search from the ground up to address this. Our new approach employs high-quality LLMs to adaptively explore a database, mimicking how a human researcher carefully discovers information. This approach dramatically outperforms (by 10-50x) traditional keyword search and other modern AI-based retrieval methods.\r\n\r\nOur first target users are the 50 million researchers searching for scientific literature on PubMed and Google Scholar every month. We’ve have paying users across fields like medicine, ML, biotech, finance, and more.",
