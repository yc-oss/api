  "long_description": "Manaflow enables businesses to build and automate internal tool workflows involving data, APIs, and actions with AI agents using natural language. \r\n\r\nManaflow replaces the boring, manual internal tools of the past with a new paradigm of internal tools built for and operated by AI agents instead of human operations teams. Let AI agents tackle repetitive research tasks, data consolidation, analytical reports, and database actions while you focus on the bigger picture for your company. Stop wasting engineering resources on boring internal tools that require even more human resources to operate them.",
