  "long_description": "Code repositories are built for humans to understand and collaborate on code. But soon, they’ll be used primarily by AIs working on our behalf. As this shift happens, the structure and processes around code must evolve.\r\n\r\nAt Palmier, we’re building a new kind of code repository designed for AIs. Every line of code has a history behind it, and we’re making that history accessible for AIs to create more efficient and reliable code, aligned with human intention.\r\n\r\nOur first product is a platform that helps developers work seamlessly with AI, improving efficiency. We aim to provide an API for any AI to interact with code, giving it the information needed to produce better quality code.\r\n\r\nReach out at founders@palmier.io",
