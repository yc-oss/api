Pharos automates this process, providing automatic submission to clinical registries, one-click RCAs and the ability to track quality metrics in real time.\r\n\r\nOur AI shows hospitals where their safety events are happening and what the root causes are, helping to reduce hospital acquired infections, readmissions and missed sepsis cases.",
