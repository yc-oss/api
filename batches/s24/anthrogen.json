  "long_description": "Anthrogen uses genetically modified bacteria and optimized enzymes to turn carbon from the air into cheap chemicals. Think Solugen but for more complex molecules/enzyme cascades and using atmospheric carbon instead of sugar as a base. \r\n\r\nWe have engineered the fastest photosynthesizing organism in the world with CRISPR and use generative models to design our enzymatic cascades. We are stating with jet/rocket fuel but will expand to other verticals soon.",
