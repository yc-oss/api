  "long_description": "Every battery company spends tens of millions of dollars a year on experiments. Simulations that replace experiments reduce these costs but are currently underutilized in industry because they are hard to create and run. We make simulations accessible to every engineer, by helping them to create models from their own data, then run large scale simulations in the cloud to explore the full design space.",
