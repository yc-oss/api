  "long_description": "Anara helps researchers understand, organize and write scientific documents, together.\r\n\r\nWe started working on Anara 18 months ago. In that time:\r\n\r\n- we’ve grown to 4M users spanning hundreds of major colleges and research-led companies,\r\n- we reached $3M in yearly revenue and are fast approaching $4M,\r\n- 200M+ people have seen our content across Instagram, TikTok and YouTube,\r\n- and we raised $2.4M from YC and the founders of Github and Reddit.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we’re expanding beyond summarization and writing assistance to address the broader challenges of information overload faced by academics and research teams.\r\n\r\nWe're a small, tight-knit team with huge ambitions and we’re hiring across design, engineering and growth. As a founding member of the team, you'll be instrumental in helping us scale revenue from $3M to $10M and then $10M to $100M+.\r\n\r\nIf you’re excited by the idea of being a part of that, definitely reach out.",
