  "long_description": "We genetically engineer bacteria to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are applying CRISPR to a novel form of bacteria to create the most accessible and scalable high-quality credit.\r\n\r\nWe use advanced robotics to harvest the bacteria in a cost-efficient manner before preparing them for long-term storage to safely store away the carbon for millions of years. \r\n\r\nClimate change is a present reality not a future; we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale as fast as possible to help reverse it. \r\n",
