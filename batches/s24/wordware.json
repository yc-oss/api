  "long_description": "Wordware is an IDE for building AI agents using natural language.\r\n\r\nIt looks and feels like Notion, but lets you design, test, and deploy AI systems in real time - without writing code.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to bring structure and joy to human–AI collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe’re building a generational company that empowers the next billion knowledge workers to create with AI - not by writing code, but by expressing intent.\r\n\r\nWe’re backed by Spark Capital, Felicis, and Y Combinator ($30M seed round - the largest in YC history).\r\n\r\nWe work hard, move fast, and don’t take ourselves too seriously. It’s intense, but it’s also fun - at Wordware, you’ll do the best work of your life alongside people you genuinely like.",
