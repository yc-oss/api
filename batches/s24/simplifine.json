  "long_description": "Research workflows are broken, forcing researchers to cobble together disconnected tools for literature review, writing, data analysis, and more—tools not designed for their needs.\r\n\r\nSimplifine changes everything. Built by researchers, for researchers, it equips you with AI agents that act like JARVIS from Iron Man, capable not only of connecting and analyzing information but also running computational experiments and simulations. Our specialized LLM Agents can design and execute complex research experiments with PhD-level expertise, compressing weeks of work into minutes. With Simplifine, you no longer need to juggle fragmented tools—everything from advanced simulations to data analysis happens in one place.",
