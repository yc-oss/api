  "long_description": "Educato builds exam prep platforms worldwide using AI.\r\n\r\nOnline exam prep has existed for decades, yet the big players all target the same top 10 exams in the US. The reality is that most exams around the world still have little to no quality online prep material, including many taken by hundreds of thousands of students each year. Educato uses AI to generate high-quality prep content for these exams. LLMs allow us to target the profitable fat middle in the distribution of exams, historically overlooked by education companies.",
