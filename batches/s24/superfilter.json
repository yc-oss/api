  "long_description": "Superfilter is an email companion that manages your inbox like a human executive assistant would. We use AI to organize your high priority and actionable emails, summarizes you latest inbox activity, give you enough context to help you respond quickly, and take low leverage tasks like coordinating meetings and signing documents off of your plate. It's a reliable companion for founders who value responsiveness without sacrificing focus and peace of mind. Superfilter is always working, improves as it learns from you, and will only leave to work for another person if you cancel your subscription. ",
