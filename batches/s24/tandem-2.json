  "long_description": "The pandemic reduced office use nationwide by 50%, and tenants have been left to deal with highly inflexible, long term lease agreements that don’t fit today’s office use patterns.\r\n\r\nThe traditional brokerage model works great for big spaces and long terms. But when you want to talk smaller units, short term lengths, shared and common areas, you’re out of luck. \r\n\r\nTandem is an AI-enabled office leasing platform. We’re using technology to unlock flexible, month-to-month agreements in quality, ready-to-go spaces.   Our AI co-pilot enables a white-glove-quality B2B office search experience, with a fraction of the human labor typically required.\r\n\r\nToday we’re serving two primary markets — NY & SF, with hundreds of active Hosts in each.  We’ve helped match more than 100 companies and have seen double-digit month-over-month growth.",
