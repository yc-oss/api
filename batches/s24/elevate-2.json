  "long_description": "We build magical data pipelines that use LLMs to integrate, clean, and enrich data living in disparate systems, delivering better KPI and financial reporting. We work with a wide range of customers, with a focus on PE- and VC-backed roll-ups where we provide a single source of truth for portfolio performance across acquisitions. \r\nOur experience is at the intersection of finance x tech. With an increasingly competitive M&A marketplace driven by $0.5T+ of dry powder, clean, usable data is a massive competitive advantage throughout the investment cycle – in diligence, to make informed investment decisions; in value creation, to execute the strategic plan quickly and confidently; and in exit, where better data leads to better outcomes.  We’re on a mission to make AI useful for any company with messy data. ",
