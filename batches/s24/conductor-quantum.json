  "long_description": "Quantum computers will allow humanity to understand the world at its most fundamental level, enabling the acceleration of drug discovery and the development of new materials. \r\n\r\nCurrently, quantum engineers spend days, sometimes weeks, manually getting their silicon chips to operational conditions to realize two qubits. A qubit is the information-carrying unit of a quantum computer, analogous to a bit in a classical computer. \r\n\r\nWe need billions of qubits to make a useful quantum computer. Therefore, automation software will be vital to realizing this goal. \r\n\r\nConductor Quantum will develop AI software to remove the human from the loop, enable the scaling of silicon quantum technology and build a silicon-based quantum computer.",
