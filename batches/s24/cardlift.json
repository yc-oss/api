  "long_description": "💸 CardLift builds co-branded browser extensions to help credit card issuers maximize their share of wallet (and in turn, per user revenue). 💸\r\n\r\n💼 Built by the serial extension founder behind TravelArrow (the world's largest travel browser extension, 300k users, 1.5M+ ARR) and OctoShop (acquired by NYSE:IBTA), CardLift is backed by YCombinator.\r\n\r\nHow it works -\r\nWe build banks and credit card issuers browser extensions to help them capture a larger share of wallet among their cardholders by -\r\n\r\n🏃 Migrating Existing Spend\r\n\r\n- When a credit card program onboards a new user, we make it dead simple for these users to switch their card-on-file at all of their top online merchants to their new card with one click.\r\n- Our AI-powered browser extension not only automatically detects where our partners' users spend the most (Netflix, Amazon, T-mobile, Progressive), but also lets them switch out their primary payment instantly. Users press a button in their browser and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (our partner's card!).\r\n\r\n😌 Making Checkout Seamless\r\n\r\n- Our fast checkout technology embeds “One Tap Checkout ” on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making our partners' cards the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser. \r\n- They can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example Chase could prompt their users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance.\r\n\r\n🤑 Making Our Partners' Cards More Rewarding\r\n- We partner with over 1000 of the country’s top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that our partners can tack on to their existing cash back. User can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they user our partners' “One Tap Checkout” button instead of their other cards.",
