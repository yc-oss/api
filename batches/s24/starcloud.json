  "long_description": "(Formerly known as Lumen Orbit) \r\nStarcloud is building a network of megawatt-scale data centers in space, scaleable to gigawatt capacity, to be able to train large models like GPT6. Falling launch costs give us access to abundant energy, passive cooling, and the ability to rapidly scale in space.\r\n\r\nIn Partnership with NVIDIA's Inception Program, we are launching our demonstrator satellite in July 2025, which will have 100x more powerful GPUs than have ever been operated in space.
