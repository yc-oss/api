  "long_description": "Outerport helps AI read documents the way a researcher would - building up understanding section by section and checking facts along the way, instead of just matching similar phrases. For example, when a team needs to confirm a specific requirement in a 200-page compliance policy document, Outerport pinpoints the right section, provides the reasoning, and presents a fact-based summary. It can leverage this deep understanding to perform more complex tasks over documents, like comparative gap analysis and change tracking.\r\n\r\nOuterport is built for performance- run thousands of queries against your critical documents, with reasoning behind every retrieval. No more faulty vector RAG.",
