  "long_description": "Paasa lets high-net-worths in emerging markets invest in dollars in globally-diversified investment portfolios.\r\n\r\nWhile high-net-worths in India have international expenses, they save in a depreciating currency. 9/10 high-net worths in India (net-worth > $1M) hesitate to invest overseas due to lack of guidance on capital controls, tax laws that change every year, and limited advisory.\r\n\r\nPaasa streamlines this with 1) a brokerage partner in the US, 2) partner banks in India for smooth remittance, 3) robo-advisory and 4) LLMs to do all paperwork.  \r\n\r\nWe want HNIs in emerging markets to better save for their child's foreign education, diversify overseas confidently, and build generational wealth in a stable currency.\r\n",
