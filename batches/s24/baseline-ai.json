At large companies, floors of people use the protocol to create the study data collection forms, clinical database design, error checks, analysis code, and data transformation mappings. We use AI to automate the process of creating everything from the protocol, saving not only spend on headcount but also months of time which can translate to up to $27M in direct costs + lost revenue saved for a single phase 3 trial.
