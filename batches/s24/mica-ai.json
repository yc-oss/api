  "long_description": "Mica builds AI Agents that automate B2B sales. Our agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up until the deal is closed.\r\n\r\nThe founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren’t just great at selling—they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. \r\n\r\nHowever, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.\r\n\r\nMica’s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.\r\n\r\nSales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead. We’ll ship a fleet of agents that automate and eventually replace every other facet of the $80b enterprise sales market.  \r\n\r\n",
