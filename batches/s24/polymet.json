  "long_description": "Polymet uses AI to help non-designers create production-ready designs and front-end code. They explain what they want or provide an image, and Polymet designs the interface.\r\n\r\nOur customers use Polymet instead of hiring designers and save thousands of dollars every month. Even their managers can design with English instead of writing design specs.\r\n\r\nThis helps these teams move faster and cover design function on their own instead of contractors at early stages and when they start to scale their can produce a lot more design work, just like Midjourney.",
