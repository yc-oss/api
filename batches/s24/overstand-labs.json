  "long_description": "Imagine that your company had an extremely knowledgeable employee who’d been at your company since its inception. This employee would have perfect awareness of all of the product features and workflows, and they know all of your customers. They’ve attended every meeting with every customer and read every single support ticket. They’ve read every word of product documentation and listened to every meeting in which any use case for your products have been described.\r\n\r\nSenta and Mihir are building Overstand: the AI manifestation of this omniscient employee. With Overstand, no revenue is left on the table due to “not knowing” about an opportunity. Overstand is able to match any expressed customer interest to its entire product understanding, ensuring that opportunities for upsell or cross-sell are clearly identified and surfaced to those responsible for account expansion.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to upsell your existing customer accounts, email founders@overstandlabs.com to schedule a demo.",
