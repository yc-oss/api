  "long_description": "Phonely uses existing call recordings to create a 'AI vocal twin' that can answer customer support calls and match or outperform call center agents. On top of that we've built a Zapier like workflow that lets businesses connect to software or transfer calls just like a person would. Our platform sits on proprietary deterministic LLM that is both cheaper and more accurate than gpt-4o for call center inquiries.",
