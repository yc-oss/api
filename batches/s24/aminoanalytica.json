  "long_description": "At AminoAnalytica, we specialize in AI-powered protein optimization. We’re developing the world's first dedicated AI agent for protein engineering (or AI protein engineer, if you will) that integrates with 'human' bioengineering teams. Common protein engineering challenges like protein property enhancement – whether it's the stability of therapeutic peptides or the activity of industrial enzymes at high temperatures – can now be done semi-autonomously, at a fraction of the cost.
