  "long_description": "Pax uses AI to automate tariff refunds (aka duty drawback) for retailers and manufacturers. We launched 4 weeks ago and have ~$200K in contracts.\r\n\r\nEach year, 80% of eligible refunds—equivalent to $15B—go unclaimed. Pax is the first AI-powered broker helping brands under $50M reclaim 3-5% of their revenue. Our algorithms generate 15% more refunds than the industry leader and reduce processing time by 99% with AI.\r\n\r\nWe are two technical founders: Penny got her PhD from MIT and, and was a former research scientist at Amazon & Flexport, where I encountered the problem firsthand. Chris is a second-time founder and former software engineer at Amazon, Brex, and TikTok.",
