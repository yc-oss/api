  "long_description": "Lumenary is a code-generation platform and IDE that makes designing rigorous, data-intensive applications feel like whiteboarding. We provide a canvas-based UI that helps users and LLMs work off the same code and infrastructure context, while programmatically generating full-stack apps from high-level specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nLumenary was founded by four best friends who met at Dartmouth College, with engineering expertise from Jane Street Capital, IMC Trading, and Palantir Technologies. They've published high impact machine learning research in venues like NeurIPS, in addition to deploying secure enterprise software managing billions of dollars and petabytes of data.",
