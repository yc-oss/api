  "long_description": "RentFlow is the first ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ rent collection platform.\r\n\r\nIn the US alone, ~ 50% of small & medium businesses, and ~ 15% of residents are behind on their rent. RentFlow’s mission is to decrease the financial and administrative burden of late rent for everyone.\r\n\r\nThanks to our partner bank, we automatically pay property managers upfront for their rent & fees on the 1st of the month. Meanwhile, business owners and residents have the possibility to pay their rent in flexible installments that adapt to their cash flow needs.\r\nWe also report timely installments to all major credit bureaus to help renters build their credit score fast while paying on their own schedule.\r\n\r\nRentFlow leverages Generative AI to provide a built-in rent collection agent and to unlock installment plans on an ongoing basis based on each tenant’s risk profile.\r\n\r\nWith RentFlow, say goodbye to late rent once and for all.\r\n",
