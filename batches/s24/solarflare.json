  "long_description": "Stream real-time, typed data to your React app from your existing Postgres database.\r\n\r\nSolarflare is an open-source tool for your Postgres DB that lets you write real-time React.\r\n\r\nReal-time applications are the future: real-time features delight users and help teams stay in sync with each other and the data they care about. We’re building Solarflare because it is still hard to build real-time features.\r\n\r\n* Go live in minutes - we integrate seamlessly with your existing infra\r\n* Write type-safe React - generate a strongly-typed client and use PG tables directly on your frontend\r\n* Fits your existing stack - no need to replace your DB, sign up to Supabase, replace your ORM, or write a new API layer\r\n* Stream user data securely - row-level security means clients only have access to their own rows",
