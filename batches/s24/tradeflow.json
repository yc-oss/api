  "long_description": "TradeFlow is AI-powered settlement for financial securities. During her time in financial services, Taryn saw firsthand how inefficient and costly it is to settle trades. Historically, it’s been difficult to improve this process because it’s heavily reliant on manual emails, disparate systems, and inconsistently structured data. However, the advent of powerful AI technology allows us to unlock greater automation than ever before. TradeFlow empowers back offices to do more with less by offloading these time-intensive tasks to AI.",
