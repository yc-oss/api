  "long_description": "As Perplexity or Gemini replaces the Google Search we all use today, it will remove the need to ever visit a website. This is an existential risk to all media brands, which is why Capitol went from zero to $1.68M in revenue during YC: all media companies need to offer THEIR OWN Perplexity-like experience to maintain their direct relationship with customers. The most trusted brand in political news and analysis, Politico, chose us to power their Politico Pro Subscription product.\r\n\r\nConsumers expect instant personalized answers. Publishers won’t build this on their own.\r\n\r\nCapitol’s API lights up publishers' websites and apps so their end users can generate personalized search results, cited research reports, and even tweet storms using the publisher’s proprietary data—all within their paywall. \r\n\r\nCapitol is the new last mile of content delivery for publishing. This market is $16b in 2023, and will grow to $85.6b in 2030.\r\n\r\nGemini and Perplexity are the imperial forces. Capitol is arming the rebels.\r\n",
