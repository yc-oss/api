  "long_description": "We’re building Kontigo, a USDC Smart Neobank for Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America.\r\n\r\nWe launched our Peer-to-Peer onramp 20 days ago and we’ve already had $540k in deposits, 10k active users and a +300k waitlist. \r\n\r\nThe founding team has built and scaled fintechs in Latam, and it’s ex-Venmo, Nubank, Rappi, MercadoLibre, Ualá, Platzi, and Yuno. \r\n\r\nWe’re already backed by DST Global, Soma Capital, Pioneer Fund, Transpose + 10 YC alums.\r\n\r\nSending money to Latin America is just as painful as holding it due to the region's fragmentation into 33 countries with 39 different currencies. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, cross-border payments to Latam are absurdly expensive (up to 20% per transaction). Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable. (some countries surpassing the trillion percent ). \r\n\r\nKontigo solves this with a USDC global wallet & a BTC savings account. \r\n\r\n- Like Venmo, but on-USDC.\r\n- Like Zelle, but for cross-border payments. No limits.\r\n- Like Nubank & Revolut, but without inflationary currencies. Bitcoin-backed.\r\n\r\nUser wallets are connected to an AI-private banker on WhatsApp to execute international USDC transactions. ",
