  "long_description": "Waypoint Transit is an AI city planner that generates civil infrastructure studies. Cities spend $50B/year on planning. With Waypoint, cities can generate reports in months rather than years, and at 30% of the cost.\r\n\r\nVarun and Ryan met at Stanford, where they graduated with degrees in CS and EE respectively. Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\r\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $50B/year on planning. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",
