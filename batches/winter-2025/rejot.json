  "long_description": "ReJot is building Fragno to let API companies go from simply exposing an API to offering drop-in integrations that work out of the box.\r\n\r\nFragno is an open‑source framework for packaging backend endpoints, data storage patterns, and frontend utilities into reusable building blocks. API providers ship full integrations, not just low‑level SDKs and docs.\r\n\r\nCustomers configure rather than write code, so integrations are both much faster to launch and far more consistent across customers.",
