  "long_description": "E-waste recycling facilities spend most of their time and effort sifting through discarded electronics, searching for valuable devices, refurbishing them, and reselling them in second-hand markets.\r\n\r\nOur first product is an AI-enabled robotic system that integrates with these facilities to assess and refurbish hundreds of laptops a day without any human intervention. The system tests laptops, wipes their hard drives, photographs them, and posts them on online marketplaces for resale, regardless of model, manufacturer, or operating system.",
