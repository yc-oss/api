It can be trained and controlled by the teacher and can grade assignments from any curriculum, year level, subject, or format. \r\n\r\nLearning like a teacher, Edexia visually breaks down its understanding of the rubric, and updates this as a teacher corrects it.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to transform education by facilitating AI’s safe and effective integration across all institutions and applications. Not using AI to replace teachers but rather to empower them—providing them with all the time and resources they need to develop their students.",
