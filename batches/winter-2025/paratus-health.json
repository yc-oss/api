We build autonomous agents that don’t just assist staff - they replace them, fully handling front desk calls, patient intake, insurance verification, documentation, and billing prep. Everything is deeply integrated into EHRs like Epic and Athena, eliminating the need for fragmented tools and manual work.\r\nNo toggling between systems. No busywork. Just one intelligent system running your clinical operations - faster, smarter, and more profitably than ever before.",
