  "long_description": "HealthKey helps doctors offices generate more revenue by finding eligible patients for their clinical trials. We match at-risk patients with cutting-edge treatments, ultimately getting patients access to potentially life-changing treatments faster.\r\n\r\nBig Pharma pays a lot of money to clinics for each patient they enroll, but finding patients who qualify is an entirely manual process today. We use AI to prescreen doctors’ existing patients against Clinical Trials’ eligibility criteria, making enrollment fast and easy.",
