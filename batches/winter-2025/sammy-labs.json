  "long_description": "At SAMMY, we do knowledge. Not “find me every time [thing] was mentioned,” but real knowledge. A compliance or legal update comes in — where does it apply, how does it affect our processes, and what should we do next?A process changes — which related processes need updating? Update them for me.\r\n\r\nWe’re trusted by some of the largest companies in the world to power their knowledge, because without knowledge, AI is just a bull**** exacerbator.",
