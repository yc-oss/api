  "long_description": "superglue replaces brittle SQL scripts, cron jobs, and one-off connectors that power enterprise operations with clean, versioned syncs you can actually understand and trust. It rebuilds the logic behind integrations, so migrating systems, adding tools, or scaling processes no longer breaks everything. Companies running on superglue roll out AI projects faster, spend less on maintenance, and future-proof their business for continuous optimization.",
