  "long_description": "ThirdLayer is an applied research and product lab building the next interface for human–AI collaboration.\r\n\r\nOur first product is Dex, an AI copilot for the browser. Think Cursor for knowledge work, optimized for speed and embedded directly where you work.\r\n\r\nMost web agents are built for set-and-forget tasks. But real work is fluid and messy—spread across tabs, tools, and evolving decisions. Dex transforms your browser into an intelligent, multimodal workspace that understands your intent through voice, text, and action. It enhances familiar interfaces, automates tedious steps, and removes the friction of handoffs.\r\n\r\nBeneath the surface, Dex is more than a browser agent — it’s a foundation for:\r\n\r\n● Long-term, cross-modal memory grounded in real workflows\r\n● A new interaction layer to replace static UI with a collaborative canvas \r\n● Personalization: understanding how individuals approach tasks and navigate software\r\n\r\nWe're building the infrastructure for adaptive, intent-aware systems that work the way you do.",
