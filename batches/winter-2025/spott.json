  "long_description": "Spott is the first AI-native ATS/CRM for recruiting & staffing firms. We built Spott because existing recruitment platforms require extensive manual work, are clunky to use, rely on fragmented add-ons, and are not designed for AI adoption.\r\n\r\nSpott combines everything recruiting firms need, from a full ATS & CRM to AI agents across the entire workflow, into one AI-native solution. It enables recruiters to focus on what matters most and close more placements.",
