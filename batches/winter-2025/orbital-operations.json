  "long_description": "Orbital Operations is developing a high thrust, reusable space vehicle for satellite defense. We protect critical satellites, like GPS and Military communication satellites, from adversarial threats, like China and Russia.\r\n\r\nOur vehicle will use the exact same propulsion systems that launch vehicles have used for decades by implementing a cryogenic management system. This will give us over 100x the thrust or current in-space propulsion.\r\n\r\nRoss and I have over 15 years of combined aerospace experience across NASA, Aerojet Rocketdyne, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Relativity Space. Weâ€™ve worked side by side for more than 3.5 years developing propulsion systems, turbomachinery, and building our own respective engineering teams.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on the first demo of our unique cryo management system and intend to launch an operational vehicle by 2027.
