  "long_description": "We use AI and high-throughput mouse studies to discover therapeutics that modify neural activity in the brain. The initial focus is on epilepsies associated with autism and Parkinson’s disease with the potential to expand to any neurological disorder underlined by a dysfunction in neural activity. Our R&D is guided by AI models trained on high-density multimodal mouse data generated in-house.\r\n\r\nWe are 3 Oxford-trained neuroscientists supported by an experienced SAB from Harvard, Science Corp (ex-Neuralink), EPFL, Meta, and UCL.\r\n\r\nIn 1.5 months since landing in SF, we went from nothing to (1) opening and operating an animal lab in South SF, (2) obtaining a proof-of-concept in mice, (3) building a multimodal AI model that directs our screening approach and (4) submitting two provisional patents; all while utilizing less than 50% of our YC funding. \r\n",
