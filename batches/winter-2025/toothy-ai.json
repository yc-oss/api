  "long_description": "We’re Toothy.ai.  We’re building AI agents for dental practices that handle everything related to patient insurance. The average dental clinic spends over 160 hours a month on insurance tasks like verifying patient policies, billing, and claims processing. Our AI agents automate this entire workflow—including making insurance calls with voice AI—saving clinics time, reducing costs, and ensuring faster reimbursements.",
