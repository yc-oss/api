  "long_description": "Cardamon is an AI powered platform that ingests relevant regulation, understands what applies to each regulated financial firm, and gets compliance officers from regulation, to obligations, to product requirements in minutes - not weeks.\r\n\r\nFinancial firms face a host of complex regulations that make it incredibly painful to launch and maintain products in a compliant way. As a Product team at Revolut, we felt this pain deeply ourselves - we had products ready to launch but stuck in compliance limbo, often for weeks. Turns out, getting compliant took as long as building the product itself. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, we dug in and were shocked by how manual and inefficient the processes were. That’s when it clicked: there’s a huge opportunity to automate the boring stuff (and solve our own problem!). Compliance teams win because they ditch the tedious tasks. Product teams win because they ship faster. Everyone’s happy.",
