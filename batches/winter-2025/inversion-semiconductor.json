  "long_description": "Inversion Semiconductor is developing the next-generation chip fabrication machine, to create the most powerful chips 15x faster. Our vision is to reshore advanced chip fabrication capabilities in the West.\r\n\r\nWe're building a lithography machine. Lithography uses light to pattern circuit features on silicon. We're scaling transistors to their physical limits by shrinking particle accelerators 1000x, to create a high power light source. \r\n\r\nUsing our light source we will double transistor density for a given numerical aperture and 3x throughput.",
