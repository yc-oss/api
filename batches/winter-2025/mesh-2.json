  "long_description": "Mesh helps finance teams close with confidence when vendor spend is variable and invoices don’t reflect true spend for that period.\r\n\r\nWe use AI to understand and consolidate vendor and stakeholder context — across emails, internal messages, and historical invoices — into a clear view of incurred, prepaid, and incoming vendor costs. This gives teams early, reliable visibility into true spend, so budgets, runway, and close are driven by actual business activity rather than invoice timing or manual guesswork.\r\n\r\nMesh is built for finance teams managing large, complex vendor bases where spend is unpredictable and timing mismatches create risk at month-end.",
