We built an open-source, visual editor for code that merges design, development, and AI.\r\n\r\nSince launching, Onlook hit #1 on Hacker News, was the #1 trending repo on GitHub—above DeepSeek—and has earned over 8,500 GitHub stars.\r\n\r\nFounded by Daniel Farrell, a designer of 10+ years and former Head of Growth, and Kiet Ho, an ex-Amazon and ex-ServiceNow engineer, Onlook is on a mission to finally solve the gap between design and development.
