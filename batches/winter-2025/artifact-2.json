  "long_description": "Artifact is a collaborative IDE for hardware engineers - accelerating every step in the engineering lifecycle:\r\n\r\nDesign → Procurement → Manufacturing → Integration → Test → Sustainment\r\n\r\nWe've raised $3.5M to build an integrated, verifiable AI copilot with an intuitive UI that reflects how hardware actually gets built. Every artifact is auto-generated and traceable to a single-source of truth.\r\n\r\nWe believe hardware engineering should be rigorous, deliberate, and system-aware. We work directly with customers solving the world's hardest technical problems to modernize how complex hardware is engineered.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, send your resume & contact info to: careers@artifact.engineer",
