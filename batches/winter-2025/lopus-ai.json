  "long_description": "GTM teams are drowning in disconnected data—Salesforce, Stripe, Mixpanel, Gong, Slack, and email. The result: leaders can’t trust dashboards, data teams get buried in ad-hoc requests, and deal teams burn days stitching context instead of driving revenue.\r\n\r\nWe have built Lopus Probe, an AI-powered GTM research platform that unifies structured and unstructured data into one governed workspace. Powered by an agentic semantic layer, it understands your company definitions, joins CRM + billing + product + transcripts safely, and delivers fast, explainable answers with lineage back to the source—turning every question into a lever for growth.\r\n\r\nEngineered by Lopus AI, the GTM weapons lab.",
