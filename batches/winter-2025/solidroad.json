  "long_description": "Solidroad builds AI agents for CX teams, starting with training and QA. Solidroad agents train human reps in a simulated environment, and evaluate their performance in live customer channels.\r\n\r\nBy starting with training and QA, our agents learn how humans learn, and their performance can be compared directly with human reps. This enables us to prove the value of the rest of the agents on our roadmap.\r\n\r\nSince launching last summer, we’ve reduced onboarding times by 50% at several of the world’s largest outsourced contact centres/BPOs like PartnerHero and Tech Mahindra, and improved go-live CSAT at Crypto.com by 3% (now above 90% CSAT).",
