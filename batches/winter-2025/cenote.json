  "long_description": "Cenote builds AI sales reps for online health clinics and deploys them for abandoned-cart and win-back campaigns.\r\n\r\nToday, digital and telehealth clinics rely on generic text blasts or human follow-up for speed-to-lead and customer reactivation. Since the lead has often gone cold and the outreach isn’t personalized, conversion is frequently below 1%.\r\n\r\nCenote’s AI agents reach out immediately, communicate on the patient’s preferred schedule, and operate across channels—dramatically increasing conversion rates and unlocking revenue that otherwise goes unrealized.",
