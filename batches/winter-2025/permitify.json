  "long_description": "City building departments are understaffed and overworked. Meanwhile, builders lobby to remove power from building departments. Because building departments are usually the only profitable/self-sustaining branch of a local government, this is problematic. Permitify allows city build-plan reviewers to 10x their productivity covering the labor shortage, reducing the time required to issue a building permit, and allowing the city government's only profitable branch to stay intact.",
