  "long_description": "Roark automates the creation of voice agent test suites from real customer journeys and AI-driven edge-case predictions, so you can validate every path before deployment. Instantly import any existing production call - or generate variations for different languages, accents, background noise levels, and more, as repeatable test cases without writing a single line of code.\r\n\r\nIntegrate regression testing directly into your CI/CD pipeline, triggering automated test suites on every build to catch regressions early. Our Evaluator blocks framework tests latency, load-testing, red-team scenarios, tool calls, compliance checks, and custom pass/fail rules tailored to your SLAs.\r\n\r\nShip voice AI updates with confidence, knowing every flow, language variant, and edge condition has been rigorously tested.",
