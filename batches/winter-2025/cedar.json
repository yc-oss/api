  "long_description": "An open-source React framework for building the next generation of AI native applications. With Cedar, connect your agent to your frontend in ways that go beyond the chat.\r\n\r\nJesse worked at Intuit, writing software for TurboTax designed for customers of all tech literacy levels. Isabelle worked at Figma and Notion, learning about the struggles of getting users to effectively use powerful yet complex products as well as GTM strategies to reach them.\r\n\r\nWith Cedar, user interaction is not constrained to a chat window. We offer tools making it easy to build a voice-enabled experience, add human-in-the-loop for agent observability, and deliver realtime analytics + human handoff when needed to Slack.\r\n\r\nReduce back and forth with CSM, decrease time to completion for important user tasks, and give your users a delightful experience using Cedar :-D",
