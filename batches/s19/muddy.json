Teams use Muddy to work with their teammates and software all in one window.\r\n\r\nMuddy consists of Spaces: project, event, or competency based feeds in which users can send updates that consist of basic multimedia messages, specific files from applications (Google Doc, Airtable Base, Figma File, +anything web based), and annotations on both.\r\n\r\nRecipients can then use those apps right in line of the messages to take the requested action or give the solicited feedback (review my design, update the CRM, approve the PR, confirm PTO in Gusto, etc).",
