  "long_description": "Rutter is building a universal API for e-commerce platforms, accounting systems and payment processors.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the financial market before Plaid, the world of business financial data is split across hundreds of platforms like e-commerce storefronts, marketplaces, accounting systems and payment processors, such as Shopify, Amazon, Quickbooks, Netsuite, Stripe and others.  \r\n\r\nEach of these platforms has its own app store or its equivalent, and the enterprising developer must spend thousands of hours building integrations in order to access the entire market.\r\n\r\nRutter is an integration layer for any company building integrations into commerce or accounting platforms. You can learn more about our universal API here: https://www.rutter.com/",
