It's impossible to use modern analytics and marketing tools without sharing sensitive HIPAA-regulated data. Our platform does the hard thing of moving data from A to B. And then we do the really hard thing of controlling the flow of sensitive HIPAA-regulated data to various 3rd-party marketing tools.\r\n\r\nWe're building the data infrastructure that safeguards patient privacy while also enabling marketing teams promote access to healthcare.",
