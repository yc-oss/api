  "long_description": "Mindset Health is on a mission to empower a billion people to manage their health by unlocking the power of their mind. We're building a digitally native ‘pharma’ company that allows us to quickly turn hypnotherapy research into highly effective, consumer-friendly mobile apps.\r\n\r\n\r\nMindset Health makes hypnotherapy accessible for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, menopause, chronic pain, depression, and more - who no longer have to pay thousands of dollars and wait months for in-person support. By digitizing a previously stigmatized therapeutic tool, we make it accessible and help it achieve the same efficient scalability, consistency, instant availability, and ease-of-use of drugs but with the feedback loop of an app. ",
