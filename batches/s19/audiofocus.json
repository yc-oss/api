  "long_description": "If we've learned anything in the last few years it's that spending time with our friends and family is essential to our well-being and happiness. Unfortunately, loud and noisy places like weddings and family gatherings hinder human connection, especially for the hearing impaired. In fact, the biggest unmet need in the entire hearing healthcare industry is hearing in noisy places. AudioFocus helps patients hear in these environments by only enhancing voices nearby the patients and ignoring ones farther away. We do this using acoustics informed machine learning and custom microphone array design.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to increase the adoption rate of 37M US adults with hearing loss, only 8M use hearing aids today.\r\n\r\nFounded by Auditory Neuroscientist & AI expert and a Hearing Aid hardware design expert.",
