  "long_description": "Hotplate is changing how people sell food across the US by giving Chefs and Bakers the tools necessary to solo launch and manage a food business online. There are talented people around the world capable of making amazing food, but either due to a lack of awareness, financial constraints, or the daunting overhead costs associated with traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, many never venture into this space independently. \r\n\r\nHotplate is fueling a new model of food sales, allowing anyone to create a storefront, announce a sale, and coordinate local pickups with hundreds, or even thousands of customersâ€”all within a 10-minute setup. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to make the food industry more available to everyone with the desire to enter it, consequently making food more accessible and diverse across the United States.",
