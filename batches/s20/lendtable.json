  "long_description": "1 in 4 Americans do not get their full 401(k) match. That means 25 million workers are leaving $24 billion on the table in free employer contributions. The primary reason these workers cannot get their match is because they do not have enough to both cover living expenses and invest. \r\n\r\nLendtable helps workers get thousands in additional income by giving them a cash advance to cover their living expenses so they can finally begin earning their employer match. Once their money has vested we take some of the match money earned in order to cover our expenses. \r\n\r\nWorkers now have thousands of dollars more without putting any money down, and we make money helping them do so -- we win if they win.",
