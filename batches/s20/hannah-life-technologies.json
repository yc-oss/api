  "long_description": "We are making a new fertility treatment that infertile couples can order with a click of a\r\nbutton to help them conceive at home. Our technology increases the likelihood of pregnancy by guiding significantly higher number of sperms towards the ovum using a proprietary combination of surface features and microenvironment optimization.\r\n\r\nThe fertility treatments available today, such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and intra-uterine\r\ninsemination (IUI), are psychologically and financially draining and come with considerable treatment-associated risks. Furthermore, over 25 million women of reproductive age in the US\r\nhave limited nearby access to fertility treatment.",
