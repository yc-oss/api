  "long_description": "Our software makes other software better.\r\n\r\nProduct teams embed CommandBar in their products to help their customers onboard faster, adopt new features, learn new worfklows, and get help in-app where they are.\r\n\r\nWhat began with our flagship product – a magical search bar that lets users find anything in the app they were using – has since grown into a powerful platform for building great software. We help our customers ship delightful product tours, surveys, onboarding checklists, in-app help docs, and AI-powered copilots – fast.\r\n\r\nWe’re obsessed with helping people get more done with computers and measure our success by the number of humans we serve. Today that’s over 15 million and counting as we work with some of the world’s most forward-thinking companies like Netlify, AngelList, Gusto, and Shortcut.\r\n\r\nWe’re well funded, have strong early traction, and have build an incredibly talented team that’s low-ego and distributed across the world.\r\n\r\nIt’s still day zero at CommandBar though. There’s a ton of room for you to have an outsized impact on our trajectory and do the best work of your career",
