  "long_description": "Mozper is bringing the weekly allowance into the digital era in Latin America. About 70% of the population in the region has never received formal financial education, and do not have the right tools to teach their children. In Brazil and Mexico alone, parents give more than $10B each year in pocket money to kids. Currently, parents must choose between giving their kids cash or handing over their own credit/debit cards. Mozper is a debit card and app where parents can give their kids an allowance, set spending rules (so they can't blow it all on video games), assign chores and even create and track savings goals. Mozper is currently available in Mexico.",
