  "long_description": "We're a team of engineers, clinicians, and operators redesigning how healthcare fundamentally works for the 80 million uninsured and under-insured Americans. We started with a simple vertically integrated primary and urgent care health plan through a network of nurse practitioners that come directly to members virtually or through in-home visits. We designed our plan to make high-quality concierge care accessible to everyone - from the Grammy winners that have used us to our uninsured members.\r\n\r\nWe're backed by world-class investors like First Round Capital, Y Combinator, Softbank along with incredible founders and operators with experience building and funding unicorns like Michael Seibel (YC, Twitch), Immad Akhund (Mercury), Allison Pickens (Gainsight), Jack Altman (Lattice), Dan Folkman (GoPuff) and others.",
