  "long_description": "we’re the largest place where you give your idea a shot.\r\n\r\nand, we mean any idea — a hip-hop album, short film, a novel, some indie software, a youtube channel — whatever.\r\n\r\nno idea is too big or too small.\r\n\r\nit all starts with nights & weekends.\r\n\r\nit's six-weeks where you can start any idea from zero on your nights and weekends, and by the end you'll have your first fans, revenue, downloads, whatever.\r\n\r\nin 2023:\r\n\r\n- 12M+ ppl saw our content across Instagram and Twitter.\r\n- more than 30,000 people joined nights & weekends to work on their own ideas.\r\n- 1,000 people flew to meet us and others like them for 3-days.\r\n\r\nand, we had 1,000 people come out to one of our physical, 3-day events.\r\n\r\nto get a sense of what this all looks like in practice, see our video for season four [here](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV/status/1719091708775059754).\r\n\r\nwe even built a [physical campus](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV/status/1678561092308705281) for people who want to go full-time on their idea and need place to figure it out -- again, we don't care how big or small the idea is.\r\n\r\noverall, it's been a journey.\r\n\r\nso, now what?\r\n\r\nin 2023, we built up massive distribution. it was all about creating really high-quality content + experiences. but, it was all very one-off.\r\n\r\nin 2024, we're fully focused on taking all our learnings and building a world class product. a product that can help millions pursue their passions and build their ideas.\r\n\r\nand, we're looking for talented engineers and designers to help us figure it out.
