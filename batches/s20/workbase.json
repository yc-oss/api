  "long_description": "We help B2B companies reduce churn and grow customer spending. \r\nOur product gives account managers access to data dashboards and priority checklists needed to proactively save customers and upsell them to more profitable products.\r\n\r\nMost companies have all the data they need to figure this out, but itâ€™s often locked away in 20 different systems. There is no central place for an account manager to easily prioritize which customers to focus on and what actions to take to help them. Workbase is the solution, by one-click integrating the data sources and customizing the interface and actions for each company.\r\n\r\nWhen working on similar internal tools at companies like Segment, we saw first-hand that proactively managing the customer journey could increase net retained revenue by as much as 20 percent.\r\n",
