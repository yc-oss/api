  "long_description": "Hypercore is a loan management software for small lenders. We help lenders automate workflows and provide them with real-time analytics and KPIs on their portfolios.\r\nSince June we are running paid pilots ($3.5K MRR), 1 LOI ($1.5K MRR). The founding team met while serving together as officers in technological units in the Israeli Defence Forces. We then established together a software development company specialized in fintech projects such as e-wallets and open-banking projects. Thatâ€™s where we discovered how archaic are the tools lenders use that are ready for disruption.\r\nHypercore is building the tools for private lenders who currently do everything in Excel, culminating in a 'Nasdaq of private loan books' - utilizing the platform to securitize loan books.",
