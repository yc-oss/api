  "long_description": "Adra is a software that helps dental clinics find cavities and other problems in x-rays faster and more accurately so they can book more procedures and increase their revenue. We started our pilot with 20 dentists 2 months ago and have already increased their clinic revenue by 12%. \r\nAdra is founded by a dentist and clinic owner, a machine learning expert, and a bioscientist.\r\nWhen every dentist uses Adra, they will bill patients an extra $52B per year. We will capture a quarter of that, making our addressable market $13B.\r\nhttps://www.adra.ai/\r\n",
