  "long_description": "Brazilians hate the experience of using the traditional mobile carriers. They force you to pay for data packages you don’t need and make it impossible to switch your plans. Fluke offers a better customer experience and that’s why we have a CAC that is 50% lower and an LTV that’s 30% higher than traditional carriers.\r\n\r\nWhat’s smart about our approach is we rent infrastructure from these incumbents and build a better customer experience on top of it. This keeps our costs lows and lets us focus on what really matters: the customer experience! \r\n\r\nWe have the best network and customers are switching to us because of the service and flexibility to build their own customized mobile plans.\r\n\r\nWe are doing in telco what Nubank did in banking in Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe are Fluke, thank you!",
