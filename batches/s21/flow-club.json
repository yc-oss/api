  "long_description": "https://www.flow.club/ is a virtual co-working space where people work in high-intensity sprints designed to double their productivity. \r\n\r\nWe envision a world where...\r\n- anyone can access deep, focused flow anytime, anywhere\r\n- working independently or remotely doesn’t have to feel like you're on your own\r\n\r\nOur mission is to build the software that powers the most inspiring and productive work environment for knowledge workers.\r\n\r\nOur members love Flow Club (https://www.flow.club/wall-of-love). We’re growing quickly, just presented at Y Combinator's Summer 2021 Demo Day, raised $5M, and hiring our founding team.\r\n\r\nWe are backed by Worklife Ventures, a firm investing in companies re-designing the way work gets done in the future, and 100 more of the world's best investors and operators. Among our investors are Paul Graham and the founders of iconic companies like Dropbox, Mercury, Quora, Outschool, and Sendbird. \r\n\r\nFinally, we are inspired by our members and hosts who we see everyday working out of Flow Club building the most incredible things. They remind us great things are built incrementally, one step at a time.",
