  "long_description": "Nasdisc is a marketplace for the $4B worth of records purchased every year.\r\n\r\nThe vinyl market has seen exponential growth in the past decade - the first 6 months of this year has already seen an increase of 108% in sales. Our platform takes a 12% cut, making this a $400mm opportunity that is more than doubling every year.\r\n\r\nPressing plants are backed up years out, bots buy limited releases in seconds, and record prices are skyrocketing in both retail and aftermarket sales. Despite this growth, the only dedicated marketplace is difficult to use, doesn’t process transactions, yet facilitates over $600mm in vinyl exchanges per year. \r\n\r\nThis is why I finally decided to quit my job at Google and recruit my best friends from college to fix it. We’re all software engineers and have been passionate about music and vinyl since we were kids, and have $50k in records ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe started building a marketplace in July and launched our website 4 weeks ago. We now have $1k / week in sales, and $50k in listings.",
