  "long_description": "Simon Says today solves the pain point of aligning a video team on the rough cut, the early stage of post production where soundbites are ordered to lock the foundation for the video story.\r\n\r\nWorking on a rough cut creates a lot of back and forth among the core teammates (producer, director, editors, clients), and often leaves out folks who should have an input early on (brand, marketing, comms, and, of course, Sandy in Legal). The traditional process looks like this: export a cut from editing software; upload it to a cloud drive; email teammates a link to it; teammates email back comments; editor collates and implements comments; editor exports another cut and the cycle continues ad infinitum. ðŸ˜´\r\n\r\nThe Problem: Video post production is stuck in yesteryear: the industry primarily uses on-prem, siloed software not built for teams.\r\n\r\nThe Solution:\r\nItâ€™s 2021: video editing should be cloud-based and collaborative. Obviously. ",
