  "long_description": "Chronic pelvic pain is a debilitating condition, that impacts over 15 million US women and costs over $39 Billion each year to manage. V-Flow medical has developed a trio of products that target the root cause of chronic pelvic pain, allowing millions of women to avoid opioid use and restart living a normal, pain free life. \r\n\r\nThe V-Flow team has successfully scaled, multiple start-up medical device companies in various clinical disciplines with a combined exit value of over $4B. We have developed a broad IP portfolio covering both device design and method of application.  A recent landscaping identified no competing IP for our indication of use. We have tested our beta prototypes and are initiating animal models ahead of a planned first in human investigation in Q1 2023. Following discussion with the NIH program advisors, we have been encouraged to apply for a phase 1 grant, call to action for the Heal initiative to find new diagnostic and non-drug treatments for chronic pelvic pain. \r\n",
