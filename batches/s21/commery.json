  "long_description": "Commery makes it easy for commercial tenants to find their perfect space, whether it is retail, industrial or office space.\r\n\r\nInstead of browsing a list of available spaces like Zillow, tenants can publicly list their commercial space requirements (sqft, location, use case, etc.) and receive inbound from brokers and landlords who have spaces that are good matches. By listing demand first, tenants can even source off-market spaces that aren't publicly available yet. ",
