  "long_description": "Selling a home is a super stressful affair due to the uncertainties involved. We help smoothen that process by guaranteeing a fair price and offering that value upfront for the seller. We’ve built up an information system that captures the details of all real estate transactions.\r\nWe’ve further developed a pricing model on top of it that helps determine the value of a home. We use this to offer liquidity to the seller by making an instant offer to purchase their house. We then refurb the property as necessary and further sell through our channel partners. ",
