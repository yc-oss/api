  "long_description": "GamerPay is a marketplace for trading gaming skins and assets without scams. We do this by integrating with games to instantly validate all trades.\r\n\r\nWe launched 3 months ago and transacted 245.000 dollars growing 30% MoM. \r\n\r\nTalking to 5.000 gamers we learned that 46% have been scammed more than once. Over half are minors, who are stuck trading for cash on social media due to their age. \r\n\r\nWe are the first to build a fully compliant system for parental consent, enabling the majority of gamers to trade legally and giving the parents peace of mind.\r\n\r\nThere are 215 million trades annually in games we support. We make 7 dollars on average per trade. So a $1.5B initial market, growing fast alongside gaming and blockchain game economies.   \r\n\r\nThe team behind previously co-founded the largest transactional marketplace for secondhand high end clothes in Denmark, with 1 million users and a yearly transacted GMV north of $40 million.",
