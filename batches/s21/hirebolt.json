  "long_description": "We are disrupting hospitality hiring by reducing the time it takes to hire staff from months to < 3 days.\r\n\r\nHiring staff is the biggest challenge for many of the 2M+ hospitality businesses in Europe. Covid and Brexit ceased the usual oversupply of candidates, making traditional job boards unable to meet employers' needs, and agencies more expensive than ever. As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",
