  "long_description": "Echoes gives engineering leaders visibility into the alignment of engineering efforts against the business goals and whether their deliveries are having actualÂ business impacts.\r\n\r\nBy doing so we enable engineering leaders to make informed decisions on hiring and priorities, to communicate effectively on their team's activity to their business partners/bosses/investors, and to build engagement by putting their team's work into context.\r\n\r\nWe achieve this by offering a seamless way for engineers to connect their day-to-day contributions to their intent, creating the missing link between tech outputs and business outcomes.",
