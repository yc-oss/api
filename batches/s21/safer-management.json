  "long_description": "Safer Management sells attendance software to public school districts and colleges. Public schools receive federal funding based on their average daily attendance, and our software ensures they get the money they need.\r\n\r\nWe started Safer Mgmt. 12 months ago after I dropped off my twin boys and experienced inefficiencies with the sign-in process. We are now in 75 public schools and two colleges with annual reoccurring revenue of $621,000. We have 82% margins and are profitable. At scale, we will charge $15 per student per year. \r\n\r\nThere are 70 million public school students in America which is a $1.4 billion dollar market opportunity.",
