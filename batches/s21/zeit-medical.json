  "long_description": "Zeit Medical leverages the power of AI and wearable sensors to deliver peace of mind for those affected by stroke. Zeitâ€™s smart headband immediately detects the onset of stroke and notifies 911. Each year more than 90% of the one million strokes in the US go untreated, resulting in life-long disability and exploding medical costs north of $100b. The lack of timely treatment is the result of delays in alerting the emergency services. More than 10 million Americans with an elevated stroke risk live with constant fear that a stroke may go unnoticed for hours, while they are asleep or alone. The company was founded by Orestis Vardoulis  PhD  a biomedical & mechanical engineer and expert in digital health (EPFL/Stanford) and Urs Naber  MD  a critical care physician (Dartmouth/Stanford). They have both seen the devastating effects of stroke in their families and came up with the idea of addressing this unmet clinical need during their Stanford Biodesign Innovation Fellowship.",
