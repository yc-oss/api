  "long_description": "The Fine Living Company (Warpfy) is on a mission to revolutionize the $800B home and kitchen market, building a tech-enabled cross-border Home Lifestyle brand from India—think Shein for Home or Williams Sonoma. \r\nOur Design-to-Manufacture-to-Consumer model cuts out the middlemen, delivering high-quality products directly to consumers (D2C), through marketplaces, and via our proprietary B2B channel, The India Wholesale Company). \r\nWith a fragmented market where 70% is dominated by single-store boutiques and online penetration is just 20%, Home and Kitchen segment is ripe for disruption. India’s share of products has been minimal due to 60%+ value inflation from intermediaries. We’re changing that.\r\nOur full-stack approach: AI Copilot-driven product design, ERP for multi-channel distribution & manufacturer retention, and optimized supply chain—offers unparalleled speed & value.",
