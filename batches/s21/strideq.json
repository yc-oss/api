  "long_description": "StrideQ (formerly SliceQ) is the automated phone ordering system for restaurants which ensures no missed calls and no missed orders. Surprisingly, 33% of restaurant customers still prefer ordering via phone calls, but front desk staff is often busy and revenue is lost.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling StrideQ our customers have increased their sales by over 10%, even while dealing with staff shortages in covid times.\r\n\r\nPhone ordering is our wedge to become the point of sale system for all restaurants. StrideQ also streamlines dine-in and online orders in one single system. It helps to run restaurants more easily by effectively managing operations during weekend peak rush. ",
