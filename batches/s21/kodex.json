  "long_description": "Kodex makes it easy for companies to process, and respond to, subpoenas from governments around the world. Agencies, like the FBI, subpoena user data from customers like Coinbase, and thousands of other companies - without Kodex, companies largely rely on email, fax, and spreadsheets to manage them.\r\n\r\nKodex is a SaaS tool that helps private sector companies manage relationships, workflows, and secure file transfer with government agencies who are seeking confidential information on a company's users. We streamline compliance operations, protect the privacy of their users, reduce error, and validate the legitimacy of government agents who are requesting information.",
