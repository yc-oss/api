  "long_description": "We're building the nation's largest digital diabetes platform for underserved Americans. There are 80 million Americans on Medicaid and 30% or more have chronic disease. Less than 1% of patients with diabetes receive needed training.\r\n\r\nWe provide a SMS-based telehealth platform to people with chronic disease on Medicaid. Our proven Healthy at Home program uses 2-way SMS interactions, weekly diabetes coaching visits, and evidence-based health education. \r\n\r\nOur vision is to reach millions of Americans that lack at-home support for chronic disease. We're billing health insurance $186 for telehealth visits and have 2 contracts underway. With your support, we can be a fully sustainable nonprofit by 2023.",
