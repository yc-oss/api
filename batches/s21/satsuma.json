  "long_description": "Satsuma is a developer tool for building applications on top of real-time blockchain data. Our product lets developers take decoded data from multiple chains, customize it for their use cases, and access it through API endpoints.\r\n\r\nBlockchains serve as distributed databases for these products, holding their most important data. However, it’s difficult to access and query that data. We believe this friction is an enormous blocker for web3 developers and that better tooling will enable mass adoption for web3.\r\n\r\nWe’re a founding team of engineers, having built data infrastructure and product as early employees at Airtable, Heap, and Y Combinator.",
