  "long_description": "Ferveret develops liquid cooling solutions inspired by nuclear power plant cooling. We save data centers 96% in cooling costs, 68% on capital costs, and reduce their carbon footprint by 40% while increasing chip performance by 2X. Today, about 40% of the electricity used in these facilities is wasted on cooling. \r\n\r\nOur technology eliminates this wasted energy.",
