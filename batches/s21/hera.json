  "long_description": "Google Calendar is built on hypotheses that are now deprecated. Now that most of our meetings are virtual, there is a massive opportunity to remove frictions at each step of the lifecycle of these meetings, and finally make calendars actionable.\r\n\r\nFrom Hera, users can:\r\n- Schedule a meeting or share availabilities\r\n- Prepare a meeting with the right context on attendees and past discussions\r\n- Join a meeting in one-click\r\n- Snooze a meeting to make sure you don't forget to follow-up\r\n\r\nAll of that without leaving the keyboard.",
