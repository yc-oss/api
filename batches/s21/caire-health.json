  "long_description": "We believe that no emergency should have to wait. To make this a reality we build AI that instantly reads medical scans and enables critical care teams to make diagnoses better than radiologists. This saves lives by getting emergencies to treatment immediately and by discharging non-emergent patients quickly so the next emergency doesnâ€™t have to wait either.\r\n",
