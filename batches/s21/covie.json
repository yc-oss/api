  "long_description": "Interacting with insurance across a variety of carriers should be undifferentiated heavy lifting - a piece of infrastructure like Stripe, Twilio, or AWS that \"just works\"in the background while your business focuses on what makes it different. We provide programmatic building blocks to make this a reality, putting a carrier-neutral API and tooling on top of insurance, starting with policy access (think Plaid, but for your insurance company) and monitoring.\r\n\r\nOur technology has a variety of use cases that range from insurance verification and tracking, financial advising, compliance & risk management, and marketing/distribution of insurance products.",
