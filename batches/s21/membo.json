  "long_description": "Membo is a next-day grocery delivery app for premium customers in Europe. Like PinDuoDuo Groceries in China, Membo is the fastest way to order your weekly groceries directly from local food producers. The convenience of supermarkets & 15-minute grocery apps comes at the expense of freshness: food that should be delivered fresh, gets bought in bulk and sits on warehouse shelves for days. To get the freshest produce, you need quick producer-to-end-customer delivery, not just quick warehouse-to-customer delivery. Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product. Membo's CEO, Vahur Hansen, was an early engineer at TransferWise, and co-founder, Paula Kink, built her own healthtech startup. Launched in Dec 2020, we've grown 30% MoM for the past 8 months and have delivered over 4000 orders in Tallinn, Estonia.",
