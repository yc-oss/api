  "long_description": "Akute Health makes an electronic medical record (EMR) system & digital infrastructure tools used by digital health companies to track patients. Our EMR is a web app used daily by clinical teams at digital health companies similar to WeightWatchers, Ro, Hims, and One Medical.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, I was diagnosed with cancer and spent 9 months in the hospital. While in the hospital, I built an app to track my own records. I needed something that was simple to use and allowed me to easily track & trend different types of data.\r\n\r\nI later turned that app into a full medical record system. We now have hundreds of customers and over 50k active patient records.\r\n\r\nWe are building the de facto EMR for digital health companies.",
