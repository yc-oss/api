  "long_description": "When ML teams send their data to companies like Scale.ai for labeling, most can only afford to label 1% or less of their datasets.  But today they don’t have a good way to pick which 1% to label. We help them pick the best 1% of their data to label.  By labeling the most representative data, they significantly improve model accuracy at the same cost.\r\n",
