We make money through tips and an optional, same-day express fee. By solving our customers' most urgent problem—illiquidity between paychecks —our cash advance business is a cheap, but profitable and repeatable hook that builds distribution for a broader challenger bank. This represents a $9 billion revenue opportunity in Canada.",
