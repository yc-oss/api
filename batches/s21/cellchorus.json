This allows our customers to discover, develop, manufacture and deliver cell therapies, antibodies, vaccines and other novel therapies faster, at lower expense, and with higher rates of success.\r\n\r\nOur customers include top-25 biopharma companies and seed-stage biotechs that are developing cell therapies, antibody therapeutics and vaccines (including one of the few companies with an approved CAR T cell therapy).\r\n\r\nHear from the team at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE9x_tm0XnI",
