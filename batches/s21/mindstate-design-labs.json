  "long_description": "We're making every therapeutically valuable emotion available on demand in pharmaceutical form.\r\n\r\nOur Osmanthus platform is an ensemble of AI models that synthesize the worldâ€™s largest datasets of psychoactive pharmacology and phenomenology, quantitatively pinpointing the combination of neurotransmitter receptor activity that underlies various emotional as well as cognitive and perceptual states.\r\n\r\nOur lead program MSD-001 is designed to be rapid-acting and produce heightened emotional and cognitive flexibility without hallucinations. MSD-001 is currently in human trials, and will be the base ingredient for multiple drug combination \"emotions in a bottle\" such as empathy, awe, clarity, or beauty.",
