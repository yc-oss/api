And they’re working with a single agent and context window instead of one in every cell.\r\n\r\nAnd Riveter’s web browsing can go further—even reading PDFs and images that may contain answers. \r\n\r\nWith Riveter, anyone can automate complex, auditable web research… without coding. \r\n\r\nOur founding team brings deep product and engineering expertise from to YC-backed companies Gusto, Retool, and Middesk.",

We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\r\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\r\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.

Our engineering copilot predicts and prevents machine failures in real time by solving problems the same way an engineer would.\r\n\r\nOur agents have access to and make sense of the structured and unstructured data that exists at factories including machine sensor data, maintenance manuals and work orders. Our simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal AI knowledge to create custom complex workflows on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts. We know that dashboards don't cut costs, actions do.",
