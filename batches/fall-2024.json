We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\r\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\r\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds. Git and branching are built-in for both code and data, so you can time-travel backwards when things break. You can start with GBs and grow to TBs.",

Our simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal AI knowledge to create custom complex workflows on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts.

This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\r\n--\r\n\r\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows.

Instead of spending hours on tedious tasks, architects can 10x their design speed with simple AI prompts.\r\n\r\nBrian and William met at Carnegie Mellon as engineers and separately had their own frustrating new construction experiences. Brian ran a tech-enabled homebuilding factory and found the design iteration process to be a massive bottleneck, while William built ground up homes in Texas and had a similar frustration. However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.\r\n\r\nAs AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.",
