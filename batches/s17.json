Unity Screen, BillionToOne's commercially available non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT), is the only NIPT that can assess fetal risk for both recessive conditions and aneuploidies from maternal blood. UNITY Screen continues to grow exponentially and is on its path to becoming the next standard-of-care, with an increasing number of publications showing its accuracy and advantages over other screening methods. We have also recently used our molecular counting technology to develop liquid biopsy tests, which have the potential to completely transform oncology care.",

We began with the 150 most common science questions that children ask teachers. We call this collection Mystery Science. Last year, more than 4 million children used Mystery Science in 50% of U.S. elementary schools. In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycles and high barriers to entry, we’ve sold thousands of schools without a single sales person. We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.\r\n\r\nWe’re now moving on to all the other questions children have that they’ll never learn in school. In the last 18 months we received over 500,000 questions from children eager for better explanations of the world.  Now we’re creating video explanations for every question. You can think of this like a visual Wikipedia for kids.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create a generation of better thinkers. We think this is the most important problem to solve in the world today.",

In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. \r\n\r\nWe design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.\r\n\r\nToday, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. \r\n\r\nOur cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.  \r\n\r\nWhat you work on at Pyka makes people’s lives better now and brings the future of electric aviation one step closer each day. \r\n",

Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.\r\n\r\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\r\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

This technology leverages a novel sensor platform we spun out of the University of Michigan. PreDxion Bio has received FDA Breakthrough Device designation and partnered with top pharmcos to monitor the immune response following CAR-T therapy and predict the development of cytokine release syndrome and neurological AEs, and for use in guiding precision medicine approaches in critical care.",

Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.\r\n\r\nSkyscrape's first market entry was with Ralph Lauren in the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.",

    "long_description": "Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\r\n\r\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don’t always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\r\n\r\nOncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\r\n\r\nWe actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. \r\n\r\nOur team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.",

This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\r\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.

Specifically, we streamline the change of ownership process for real estate and create more seamless ways for tax offices to communicate digitally with their taxpayers.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, when properties get bought and sold, local governments have to process reams of paper in order to update their systems and perform the analyses necessary to update the tax roll. Our software makes this process 10x faster and much more enjoyable for employees in the tax office to complete, and creates trust and goodwill in the minds of taxpayers. ",
