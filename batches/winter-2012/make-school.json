Our bachelor's degree program combines liberal arts, computer science theory, software development, and character development with an emphasis on preparing students for successful careers as software engineers, product managers, or entrepreneurs. Our alumni work at Facebook, Google, Apple, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Lyft and more.\r\n\r\nOur college is accessible to students of all backgrounds, 40% are underrepresented minority students and 50% come from low income families.
