  "long_description": "Amiato's real-time integration service moves your data to where it's\nmost valuable to you. Today's flexible databases like MongoDB and\nCouchBase let agile businesses accelerate and scale their operations,\nbut analyzing their data has been elusive. Amiato unlocks the value of\nthat unstructured data by bridging the gap to familiar tools in the\nrich structured world of BI, all with zero setup work. Run reports, do\ninteractive ad-hoc analysis, and combine disparate silos. Our\nSchema-lift (TM) technology allows you to immediately integrate new\nendpoints and seamlessly keep up with changes in your data. We get\ncustomers up and running in a day instead of weeks, and let them focus\non business instead of wrestling infrastructure.",
