  "long_description": "99dresses allows women all across the U.S. to buy, sell & trade fashion with thousands of shopaholics. Nikki Durkin, the founder of 99dresses, was sick of spending so much money on new clothes only to get bored with them a week later and rarely ever wear them again. She started 99dresses in her home country of Australia as a way for thousands of Aussie girls to conveniently trade fashion with each other online. Now based in NYC and working with a fantastic team (Marcin, Chandra, Oguz & Clare), she is bringing 99dresses to women across the USA.\n\nGet the iOS app: http://bit.ly/1fWeoRG",
