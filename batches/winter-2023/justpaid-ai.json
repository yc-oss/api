  "long_description": "Automate accounts receivable with JustPaid â€” a delightful billing platform with powerful APIs.\r\nðŸ“¬ Contact us: yc@justpaid.ai\r\n\r\nBilling for Product-Led Growth is easy with Stripe â€” if youâ€™re offering a few simple monthly plans.\r\n\r\nBut Sales-Led Growth? Thatâ€™s where things get messy. Every customer has unique terms â€” custom pricing, usage tiers, discounts. Managing it manually means hiring people, which adds cost and risk of human error.\r\n\r\nJustPaid makes it effortless. We extract billing logic directly from your contracts â€” PDFs or CRM â€” and generate accurate, timely invoices. Our robust API lets you integrate billing into your existing workflows, so you stay in control.\r\n\r\nNo pricing disputes. Faster cash flow. Fewer headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nOur values:\r\n\r\nWe are always asking ourselves, how can we make a company's team's life easier to help them scale through financial technology?\r\n\r\n- We donâ€™t settle.\r\n- We are passionate.\r\n- We are serial entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nWe aim to make a dent in the universe",
