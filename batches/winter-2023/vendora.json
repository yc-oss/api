We build software to serve the $1 trillion dollar (over 3% of US GDP) grocery industry. This ranges from point of sale, payments, e-commerce, inventory management, loyalty, and advanced analytics with more on the horizon. \r\n\r\nWe’re taking bleeding edge technology and an AI-focused approach to modernizing an industry stuck in legacy software and practices. Backed by Y Combinator and investors with deep expertise in retail, we are a team of operators from Amazon, Uber, Tesla, Figma and McKinsey in transforming a sector that touches us all.\r\n\r\n",
