  "long_description": "Depot is a build acceleration platform making builds up to 40x faster for Docker containers and GitHub Actions. Companies like PostHog, Wistia, Appsmith, and Secoda use Depot to save tens of hours of build time every day.\r\n\r\nWe offer a remote container build service for building Intel & Arm Docker images, from your CI or local machine, up to 40x faster. Our container builds come with in-depth build insights, ephemeral registries, and instant cache sharing across your team.\r\n\r\nFinally, we also offer our own Depot GitHub Actions Runners that brings all the speed of Depot to your entire GitHub Actions workflow at half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners, and up to 10x faster builds. Simply change the runs-on label of your existing workflow to route jobs to Depot runners.\r\n\r\nKyle and Jacob worked together as staff engineers for 4.5 years at Thorn and Era Software, before founding Depot. Depot is their solution to the wildly inefficient container build tooling and non-performant CI systems they encountered throughout their careers. \r\n",
