  "long_description": "Pricing Strategy is one of the most powerful levers that retailers have at their disposal to create growth, yet it is underleveraged. Most retail pricing teams settle for making decisions in spreadsheets, shooting in the dark, and working backward from a cost-plus margin target, leaving a LOT of money on the table.\r\n\r\nOur founders experienced these problems at scale when they built pricing tech at Uber that made Uber a billion dollars in profit a year. They realized that retail was lacking the same quality and sophistication of price tooling. So, they built Luca.\r\n\r\nLuca is an AI-powered co-pilot for retail operators, which constantly identifies revenue and profit headroom, makes recommendations for price adjustments and saves countless work hours along the way. \r\n\r\nLuca is backed by Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, and others.",
