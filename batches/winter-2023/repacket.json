  "long_description": "90% of security breaches are caused by a simple employee mistake. \r\n\r\nYour employee clicks a bad link, and gives up their password.\r\nThey download ransomware from an email and run it.\r\nThey leak your intellectual property and sensitive customer data to ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nRepacket allows your employees to enjoy the internet without risk - instantly blocking threats like phishing and sensitive data leaks. This gives your employees the ability to make that mistake without impacting your company.\r\n\r\nRepacket is built for smaller companies, who may not have dedicated IT or security people to run the show. We install in 60 seconds and give your employee instant protection where they need it most.\r\n\r\nFounded by cybersecurity leaders from SpaceX, AWS, and Google - we're building the easy button for cybersecurity.",
