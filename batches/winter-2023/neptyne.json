  "long_description": "Neptyne is the first natively programmable spreadsheet, with a full Python environment, just like a Jupyter notebook. And we built in AI to make it easy to use, even if youâ€™re not a Python expert. Neptyne turns anyone who can use Excel into a programmer.\r\n\r\nAt Google, Douwe launched products to millions in Search, Mobile and workplace. He founded multiple startups, and published a book on deep learning. 4 years ago Douwe rejoined Google, where he met his cofounder Jack and the rest of the team.\r\n\r\nNeptyne launched on Hacker News in February 2023, and since then users have made thousands of spreadsheets.  People have built everything from option trading systems to machine learning classifiers using Neptyne.",
