  "long_description": "Do you run into these problems with Github Copilot?\r\n- Bad completions that break your train of thought when you’re writing comments?\r\n- Doesn’t close brackets, or adds too many closing brackets?\r\n- Functions, variables, and libraries not being auto-imported after accepting a suggestion?\r\n- Multi-cursor mode not working?\r\n- Wish copilot could name your variables?\r\n- Wish copilot could trigger in the middle of a line?\r\n- Want to stop wasting time with GPT3.5 chat and default to GPT4?\r\n\r\nDouble is an high quality alternative to Copilot inside VS Code, engineered for performance. It’s designed with great craftsmanship by people who care a lot about getting the small details right.",
