  "long_description": "Sage is a self-generating, self-maintaining knowledge base for your code with in-built chat, accelerating expertise, and comprehension of any codebase.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is perpetually stale, codebases become increasingly old, large, and complex, and knowledge remains siloed within individuals and teams. As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\r\n\r\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \r\n\r\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.\r\n",
