They are often untyped, unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.\r\n\r\nFern helps companies deliver SDKs and API documentation that they’re are proud to share with their customers. Since launching in 2023, we’ve been trusted by over 200 customers, including industry leaders like Square, Webflow, ElevenLabs, Auth0, and Intercom, to power their developer and agent experiences.\r\n\r\nWe’re fewer than 40 people, based in Brooklyn, NY, and are building open source.",
