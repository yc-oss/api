  "long_description": "Sanvivo builds a multisided platform to enable customers to order medications, get pharmaceutical advice, and book health services at local pharmacies in Europe. Just like Shopify for pharmacies.\r\n\r\nSanvivo gives pharmacies software to take, fill and schedule delivery for online orders. We also bring instant demand through integrations with 3rd party consumer delivery companies.\r\n\r\nAlmost all pharmacies in Europe are, by law, local 1-person businesses. And they are not ready for online orders. Regulatory changes require pharmacies to take and fill e-prescriptions (roll-out Jan-23), but many have no way to do this online today. \r\n\r\nSanvivo uses technology to give local pharmacies digital superpowers, enabling them to combine fast supply and high-quality consultation with state of the are e-commerce solutions.",
