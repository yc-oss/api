  "long_description": "Loula is a software platform and national provider network for independent birth & postpartum doulas to boost their practices by accepting health insurance. Doulas typically operate outside of the traditional healthcare system and face an enormous learning curve and administrative burden when trying to accept insurance. This is why we created Loula. Starting with doulas in California, Loula handles their credentialing, contracting, and revenue cycle management so that they can focus on delivering the best quality care to their clients.",
