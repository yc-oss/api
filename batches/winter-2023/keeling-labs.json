  "long_description": "Founded in 2022, Keeling Labs was started as a place to develop and apply machine learning to solve the world's biggest problemâ€”climate change. Our current priority is getting the grid to run on 100% clean energy, which is currently limited by battery storage (specifically, the algorithms that control them).\r\n\r\nWe're redefining these algorithms to unlock gigawatts of untapped energy storage capacity, enabling the grid to run on more clean energy from wind and solar.",
