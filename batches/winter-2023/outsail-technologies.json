  "long_description": "OutSail Technologies is building unlimited-range wind-powered vessels using aerospace technology.\r\n\r\nWe know modern aerodyamics can make wind cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion.\r\n\r\nThe effects of fossil-fuel use are degrading the ocean and destroying the planet. Itâ€™s time for modern wind power.\r\n\r\nOutsail has brought a groundbreaking technology from satellites, the tape spring, to earth. Our fully autonomous, retractable wingsail allows vessels to access more wind power than ever before by providing both the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing and the perfect amount of area for the wind strength.\r\n\r\nOutSail is backed by Y Combinator (W23), and founded by two engineers and an aerodynamics PhD who have led teams, managed products, and designed hardware for Momentus, Nuro, AEye, Tesla and SpaceX.\r\n\r\n",
