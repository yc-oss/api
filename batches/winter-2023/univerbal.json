In unscripted and dynamic conversations, users can talk about anything they’d like using the microphone, with the AI responding as it adapts to their level and skills. Each user gets a personal AI Language Tutor that creates a custom learning plan based on the language goals they’d like to work towards and their own interests, offers instant corrections after every message and helps users in their own language.\r\nBased in the country with 4 official languages, Switzerland, in 2024 we were selected as one of WIRED’s Hottest 100 Startups in Europe.",
