This commitment has driven us to truly innovate, saving our customers from outrageous third-party costs and week-long lead times.\r\n\r\nWe offer point of sale, inventory management, and more to our growing community of entrepreneur and experienced restaurateurs. Our tech is as user-friendly as an iPhone, yet powerful enough to power Starbucks. \r\n\r\nPoloTab is led by a team driven by the vision that things should be different, with the skills to make it happen. We were born from the food & beverage industry and are here to make a difference, not merely be part of the crowd.",
