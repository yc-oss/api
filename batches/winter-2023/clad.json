  "long_description": "Our goal is to help build infrastructure faster.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we're building a platform to help infrastructure owners and contractors manage every aspect of their construction process. Clad makes it easy to track daily progress, schedules and finances. \r\n\r\nWith Clad, contractors get paid faster\r\n\r\nWe're focused on internet infrastructure first (laying fiber optic cable, building cell towers). Over time, we'll power all infrastructure construction - roads, power, solar, EV charging, and more, so the backbone of our world gets built faster..",
