  "long_description": "Radical’s StratoSats are autonomous platforms that provide satellite-like services on demand. They fly within Earth’s atmosphere to provide persistent, high performance infrastructure across applications in earth observation, connectivity, and more. Unlike satellites, StratoSats navigate freely without the need for rocket launches or orbits - reducing costs, increasing flexibility, and ensuring customers get the targeted coverage they need.",
