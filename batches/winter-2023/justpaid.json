  "long_description": "We make it easy for founders to do billing right out of demo day.\r\n\r\nEvery B2B startup faces the same billing nightmare: unique customer terms, custom pricing, usage tiers, and discount structures that make manual billing a costly mess. Hiring billing specialists adds overhead and introduces human error right when you need to move fast.\r\n\r\nJustPaid makes billing effortless by extracting billing logic directly from your contracts—whether they're PDFs or stored in your CRM—and automatically generating accurate, timely invoices.\r\n\r\nAlready using Stripe, DocuSign, CommonPaper, HubSpot, or Salesforce? We integrate seamlessly with your existing stack.\r\n\r\nMaintain control while automating the complexity. No more pricing disputes. Faster cash flow. Fewer headaches.\r\n\r\n- Move fast: Bill customers from day one without hiring specialists\r\n- Scale smart: Handle complex pricing models without operational overhead\r\n- Stay focused: Spend time building your product, not managing invoices\r\n- Reduce risk: Eliminate human error in billing calculations\r\n\r\nWe're always asking ourselves: How can we make a company's financial operations effortless so teams can focus on scaling?\r\n\r\n- We don't settle\r\n- We are passionate\r\n- We are serial entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nWe aim to make a dent in the universe.",
