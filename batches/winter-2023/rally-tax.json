  "long_description": "For millions of Americans, taxes are far more than a simple W-2. Managing investments, property, or a side business creates a world of complexity that makes DIY software risky, while traditional CPA help is often slow, expensive, and reactive. This broken system causes anxiety and leaves billions in potential savings on the table every year.\r\n\r\nRally is the modern solution for tax peace of mind. We are an AI-powered tax platform that provides proactive, year-round strategic guidance, not just seasonal filing. Our unique approach combines a smart platform that automates 80% of the manual work with a team of in-house experts to provide strategic advice. We deliver the expertise of a private advisor with the convenience and access of a modern tech company.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to use the trust we earn in taxes to become the definitive financial co-pilot for our customers. We will expand from tax strategy into a full suite of services that helps millions of people proactively manage and optimize their entire financial future.",
