  "long_description": "A brand new way to create landing pages that's video-native. Traditional ways of building landing pages are too costly (money & time) and brands want to experiment more. Our landing pages rely on video content to do the heavy lifting from a dev & design perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur landing pages convert well (+15-30% across channels such as paid ads, email, and sms) and take <20min to create. This means brands can test over 10x what the currently do with Viddy.",
