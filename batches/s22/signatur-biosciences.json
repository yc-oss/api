  "long_description": "We make precision diagnostics more accessible, starting with breast cancer prognosis. Current tests that guide the use of therapy are really slow and expensive because they need to be run in complex centralized facilities. Our tests are designed to be easily run by local hospital labs, reducing turnaround time from over three weeks to a few days and for a fraction of the price.",
