  "long_description": "Delight is an AI copilot to help singles find and succeed in relationships. We’ve started with helping singles looking for a serious relationship find the right partner. For example, they talk to our AI copilot, as if they’re talking to a human matchmaker, in plain English they specify their preferences. They can be as specific as possible, e.g. someone with an entrepreneurial spirit, who appreciates fine art, enjoys discussing politics and comes from a big family. Our technology then finds their ideal partner. \r\nSo far, we've helped create over 10,000 couples and in the future our AI copilot will offer these couples support for relationship success, like improving their communication, financial planning, couple’s legal assistance, and navigating life events.",
