  "long_description": "Relay is an app that helps people overcome addiction through peer support and accountability – starting with pornography addiction. It’s like if Alcoholics Anonymous were invented in 2024.\r\n\r\nFor example, when someone is struggling in isolation, Relay matches them with 3-7 other peers with the same challenge, makes it easy to reach out for help when vulnerable, and enables change through shame-free accountability and facilitated connection.",
