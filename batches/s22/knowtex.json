  "long_description": "Weâ€™re on a mission to leverage AI and voice technology to solve inefficiencies and revenue leakage in our healthcare system. With the rise of EHRs, the manual documentation burden on doctors has never been higher, leading to burnout and fatigue and high attrition rates. Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\r\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.
