Nigeria makes up $0.5T, 50% of which comes from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) â€“ a huge number of these operate within large manufacturing supply chains.\r\n\r\nStarting with Freight Carriers Pivo makes financial services easily accessible for truck owners and truck drivers by providing a bank account, debit card and digital invoicing tools so they can get paid faster and avoid cash flow problems.\r\n\r\nThis will be further augmented by more fundamental financial products such as credit, transaction management, and expense management, to improve their cashflow.
