  "long_description": "Morf is an integration platform that allows healthcare providers to sync patient data and automate workflows across their tools. For example, when a patient submits an intake form, Morf creates a patient record in an EHR and sends insurance information for an eligibility check. You can think about it like Segment + Zapier for healthcare providers.\r\n\r\nMorf helps their customers eliminate tedious administrative tasks and empowers them to focus on patient care as they grow.",
