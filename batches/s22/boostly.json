  "long_description": "Boostly uses behavioral-based marketing and gamified SMS-based experiences to get 10x greater consumer engagement for restaurants than traditional means leading to significant revenue boosts. Critically, Boostly also builds the audiences to engage with from scratch (bigger and faster than anyone else) by connecting all sources of consumer data available to the restaurant. Notably, this is all done while requiring as little as possible from busy restaurant operators, enabling this critical function of their business to remain hands-off via Boostly's dedicated experts.
