  "long_description": "Coupl is India's first neobank for couples. We help couples easily manage their shared and household payments using our digital joint account.\r\n\r\nOver 20 million Indians marry each year, creating a $300 billion market opportunity in household expenses. Couples juggle multiple accounts, cards, and expense-tracking tools. Joint accounts involve lengthy paperwork, rejections, and minimum balance requirements, making them inconvenient for modern couples. Beyond married couples, this need extends to engaged partners, live-in couples, roommates, and families seeking simpler ways to manage shared expenses.\r\n\r\nCoupl offers a digital, zero-balance joint account with co-branded debit cards and in-app bill payments, set up in just 60 seconds. Couples can use the account for all shared expenses, with an analytics dashboard to help them stay on top of their finances.\r\n\r\nCoupl is powered by RuPay, NPCI and IDFC FIRST Bank.",
