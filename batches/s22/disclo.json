  "long_description": "Disclo is the first software for employers to collect, verify, and manage health disclosures and employee accommodation requests (HIPAA and SOC2 compliant, of course).\r\n\r\nWe help employees secure the enhancements and protections they need to succeed in their careers without having to disclose their underlying medical condition to their employer. We handle the collection of that data, the verification, the secure data management, and much more.\r\n\r\nUsing our patent-pending medical verification system, Disclo validates that an employee's accommodation request is legitimate and required, interacting with medical providers directly, so HR managers can focus on what they do best. We help companies stay compliant with EEOC, ADA, and HIPAA guidelines.",
