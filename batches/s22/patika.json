By extracting customer order details from various formats—including emails, PDFs, and handwritten notes—and accurately entering the data into ERP systems, Sanifu significantly reduces manual data entry time and errors. This automation enhances overall efficiency for businesses, allowing them to scale more effectively and focus on core operations. We are targeting a market of 180,000 manufacturers and distributors across Africa, representing a $2.5B+ opportunity.\r\n\r\nSidney and Phelix, who met 10 years ago at a leadership program by Mastercard and Equity Bank, are technical founders with 5+ years experience working together to build payments platforms that processed $10M monthly GTV across Kenya, Uganda & Nigeria.",
