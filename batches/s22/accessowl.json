  "long_description": "AccessOwl automates employee SaaS account provisioning and permissioning for any tool. IT teams from companies like Zeplin and Sary save 30 minutes on every request.\r\n\r\nAccess management used to be an enterprise problem. With work from home, exploding SaaS usage and the need for SOC2 certifications startups have the same problems as enterprises. \r\n\r\nMathias and Philip have built several startups and teams before and experienced the same problems around access management over and over again. Philip was the CEO and Co-Founder of blik, an award winning IoT solution that was used by Volkswagen and BMW. Mathias built the leading private payment infrastructure provider in Germany as well as the first digital car insurance as Co-Founder and CTO. Based on these experiences we decided to build a solution we wish we could have used when building our former companies.\r\n\r\nAccessOwl can be deployed within minutes instead of weeks by simply installing a Slack application. We save companies that use AccessOwl 30 minutes for every access request, on- and offboarding. ",
