  "long_description": "Turkey is MENAâ€™s largest economy, with ~850,000 independent truckers and a logistics market of 73 Billion USD. However, in its current state, freight forwarding for trucking relies on many phone calls, emails, and f2f conversations. Trucking is also fragmented, with SME fleets having ~95% market share. \r\n\r\nKamion is the Uber for Trucks for Turkey. We connect businesses that are looking for trucks, with trucks that are looking for loads. We also utilize technology to do more with fewer people and collect data.\r\n",
