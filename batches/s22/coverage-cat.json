  "long_description": "Coverage Cat (https://www.coveragecat.com) is the best way for people to optimally insure against their risks for homeowners, auto, renters, and general liability insurance. Millions of wealthy but insurance-unfamiliar Americans have purchased policies that leave them vulnerable to million-dollar lawsuits and bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nCoverage Cat fixes their coverage and offers them cheaper premiums with a focus on the central question of insurance: \"how much can you afford to lose?\" This risk-first approach allows for policies with higher deductibles that no other insurer will sell you, and enables us to find the multi-million dollar coverage, for truly catastrophic events, that our users need.",
