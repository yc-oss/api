  "long_description": "UpLink's founding team worked as auditors and software engineers at PwC where they saw firsthand how difficult it was to collect thousands of documents from clients.\r\n\r\nAlex Maher and Alex Grant met working on PwC’s big data analytics platform, scaling it from 0 to 20k users globally. Brady and Nick met while studying CS at a top 5 public university, but still insist they were self-taught. They were, by far, the top developers on Alex Maher’s team before starting UpLink. Together they ran Dycom's field systems segment, supporting 15k users.\r\n",
