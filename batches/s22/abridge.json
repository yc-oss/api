With Abridge, shippers (i.e. importers/exporters) can book freight, automate compliance documents, track shipments, and communicate with supply chain partners all in one place via Abridge's integrated online platform.\r\n\r\n90% of freight logistics companies (i.e. the current alternative for shippers) still follow largely manual processes. By automating these processes, Abridge is helping companies with logistics activity in India run the modern supply chain of the future.",
