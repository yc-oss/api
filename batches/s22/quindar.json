  "long_description": "Quindar is a web app used by satellite owners to analyze, test and operate their constellation. For example, Airbus could use Quindar to operate their satellite fleet with minimal human intervention.\r\n  \r\nWeâ€™re six former OneWeb engineers who helped build the software platform that currently operates the second largest satellite constellation in the world.\r\n \r\nThe space industry is shifting from companies launching a handful of satellites over a decade, to launching hundreds of satellites EACH in just a few years. Our SaaS platform automates mission management and for a single engineer to operate hundreds of satellites instead of the traditional model of many engineers operating a single satellite.",
