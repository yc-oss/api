  "long_description": "Launched in 2022, HOMLI is a modern, scalable real estate brokerage that helps European consumers sell, rent, and buy real estate.\r\n\r\nWe are building Europe's first 'Zestimate' platform to finally bring transparency around property prices and neighborhood dynamics to all consumers across Europe. We couple that with an in-house brokerage team that is more effective, more productive, and more pleasant to work with.\r\n\r\nWe combine the most advanced technological innovations with a holistically new approach to operations to re-invent a brokerage industry that hasn't evolved in decades, and introduce a brand new real estate experience for European consumers.",
