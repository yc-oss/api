  "long_description": "Bitstack is building a new neobank powered by crypto. Bitstack has gone from a simple product that turns your spare change into bitcoin to a bitcoin-native neobank that is bringing a better way to manage all things money, with better money. We believe getting started with Bitcoin should be simple, fun and accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is an unparalleled financial alternative: a radically new way to transact and store value all around the world. It is a new kind of currency that isn't centrally controlled by any business, government or bank and that cannot be debased. Bitcoin will redefine the future of finance, from payments to savings, and wealth preservation. It is the first open and borderless monetary network with a fixed supply of 21 million, making bitcoin the most scarce financial asset ever.",
