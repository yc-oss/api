  "long_description": "People.ai accelerates enterprise growth through the power of AI.  Founded in 2016 on the premise that AI and machine learning technologies can help automate CRM functions that humans often leave behind, it has grown into a platform that powers actionable insights across go-to-market functions. The platform has become the cornerstone of decision-making for enterprises such as Zoom, PTC, and Hexagon PPM, eliminating guesswork to create an unprecedented level of intelligence for those and other businesses looking to grow and thrive in a competitive digital landscape.\r\n\r\nPeople.ai does this by automating the ingestion of GTM data from primary sources like email systems. We then translate this information into actionable insights that help sellers, marketers, and operations leaders deliver more pipeline growth that leads directly into revenue and margin growth. We call it our next-generation revenue engine, which helps companies accelerate opportunities and close deals faster.",
