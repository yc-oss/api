  "long_description": "Reebeez develops efficient solid-state thermoelectrophotovoltaic microengines for UAVs that achieve flight times and payloads unrivaled by batteries and fuel cells.\n\nDue to weight limitations of engines, small aerial vehicles must rely on lithium polymer batteries that result in disappointing flight times and payloads. Reebeez presents a propulsion ​system powered by thermoelectrophotovoltaics (TEPV) that runs on lightweight combustible fuels to attain specific energy eight times better than lithium polymer batteries - at a third of the cost.",
