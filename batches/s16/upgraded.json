  "long_description": "Upgraded helps retailers and carriers sell devices on subscription. Subscribers pay monthly and can upgrade anytime. Smartphones, laptops, tablets and more.\r\n\r\nCreating and managing these programs involves lender integrations, residual value management and building great software — resellers don’t know how to do this. \r\n\r\nUpgraded provides the infrastructure to launch immediately, keep customers loyal and cut replacement cycles in half. Device financing is a $541B market globally. US carrier financing grew from $13B to $51B in the last four years. \r\n\r\nUpgraded partners include Apple, Dixons/Elkjøp, MediaMarkt and Vodafone. Upgraded was founded in 2016. Investors include Y Combinator and GRIL Ventures.\r\n\r\nUpgraded is led by CEO John Erik Metcalf and CTO Ziad Sawalha.",
