Co-built alongside educators and interventionists, Emote continuously analyzes behavioral and social-emotional data to surface early indicators of need and deliver actionable insights. Schools using Emote can support 8x as many students, 12x earlier, ensuring staff have both the awareness and guidance to provide the right support at the right time.
