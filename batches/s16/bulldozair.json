  "long_description": "Bulldozair is a technology company backed by Y Combinator (US), Station F (EU) and Kima Ventures (EU).\r\n\r\nWe provide a collaborative web and mobile platform that helps companies that own real estate or industrial assets to deliver their construction projects on time and on budget.\r\n\r\nBulldozair digitally integrates all the construction process, compliance and checklists and deliver them to contractors and engineering teams. \r\nUsers follow their project progress on Dashboard and are alerted anytime there is a potential delay or technical risk and can collaborate online with those companies to solve problems.\r\n\r\nWith their mobile application, construction teams collect data on the field (forms, measurements, pictures, plans...) that are uploaded  directly on a collaborative platform.\r\nAll that communication between stakeholders is archived for traceability. \r\nAll the legal and contractual reporting that took weeks is now done automatically.\r\n\r\nBulldozair is now deployed across the biggest names of the corporate world in infrastructure construction  but also in  manufacturing, energy and retail.",
