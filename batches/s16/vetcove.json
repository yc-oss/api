Our community of more than 18,000 veterinary hospitals employs tens of thousands of veterinarians and delivers care to many millions of animals every year across all 50 states.  As of 2022, we power purchasing and supply chain infrastructure for half of America's general practices, emergency and specialty clinics, SPCAs, zoos, aquariums, and veterinary consolidators.\r\n\r\nVetcove's eCommerce and mobile platforms afford veterinary hospitals a frictionless purchasing experience, and facilitate delivery of medications to pet parents across the country. Simply put, Vetcove helps veterinary organizations spend more time giving care, and less time comparing suppliers and managing inventory. We're completely revolutionizing the way veterinarians discover and buy products, and how animal health brands engage their veterinary customers.\r\n\r\nWe're hiring!  Come join us on our journey to transform how vets buy and prescribe the animal healthcare products that keep our pets in peak condition.",
