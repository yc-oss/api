We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.\r\n\r\nClipboard Health is a fast-growing Series C startup with classic two-sided network effects. We have product-market fit, generate substantial revenue, and we are helping nurses fix healthcare one shift at a time.\r\n\r\nClipboard Health is a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote-first team of hundreds of people.
