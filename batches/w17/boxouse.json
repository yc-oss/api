  "long_description": "Boxouse is the product of curiosity and mishap by Luke and Heather. They build beautiful, sustainable, portable, affordable houses for everyone.\n\nInspired by portable, modular shipping containers and fed up with paying rising rents in San Francisco for non ideal housing they set out to redefine the landscape in which they lived and rethink housing for modern aspirations.\n\nBoxouse started on a vacant lot in 2013 and quickly grew into a community of friends who all shared a common goal of experimenting with sustainability and building. They still run all their production out of beautiful Oakland California.\n\nTheir catalogue offers a variety of houses from minimal to a luxe edition with wheels, solar and full utilities.",
