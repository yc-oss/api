  "long_description": "We are a group of expats in Hong Kong that want easy and affordable access to buy the products we love from back home. Snacks, foods, health products, and other daily essentials that we miss are either not found in Hong Kong, or are too expensive to buy. We were faced with bad alternatives such as overpriced grocery stores, or expensive package forwarding companies.\r\n\r\nWe believe that with the help of technology, anyone should be able to buy anything from around the world at an affordable price. We are on a mission to make international commerce seamless.",
