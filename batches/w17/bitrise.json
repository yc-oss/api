  "long_description": "Bitrise helps you automate your daily app development tasks from building through testing to deployment. With Bitrise you can configure these tasks with a unique, visual workflow editor, with dozens of service integrations ready to roll. We call these steps, and they are all open source! If the step you need is not in our collection you can create your own and share it with others. Project Managers can get a clear picture of the development and testing of apps, testers get regular notifications about available, testable builds, and clients are able to collaborate with the rest of the team. Bitrise is free to get started and takes just 50 seconds to setup your first project.",
