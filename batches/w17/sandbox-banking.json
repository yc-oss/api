Our software is literally a web application named Glyue, and it's typically used by banks, credit unions, and fintechs to connect banking systems.  Glyue integrations are often web service APIs, batch ETL jobs, file/document transfer jobs, or event-driven pub/sub services (e.g. web hooks, Kafka streaming data pipelines).",
