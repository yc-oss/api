We cut out the middlemen, the brands, the physical stores and the markups — to make products cost a lot less, all while paying the producer more.\r\n\r\nWhy we do it\r\nTo add meaning to people’s lives through\r\nproducts they use and love, made by people who\r\nknow and care, with stories that matter, and\r\nmeans that are honest.",
