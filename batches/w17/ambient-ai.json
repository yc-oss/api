  "long_description": "Ambient.ai is a computer vision intelligence company transforming enterprise security operations to prevent security incidents before they happen. The Ambient.ai platform applies AI and computer vision intelligence to existing sensor and camera infrastructure to deliver continuous physical security monitoring and automate the immediate dispatch of human resources. Ambient.ai is the first platform that goes beyond basic motion detection and image recognition to achieve near-human perception with automated situational context. \r\n\r\nWith physical security incidents on the rise and physical security organizations left under-resourced, Ambient.ai’s computer intelligence platform comes at a time of critical need, which is why the company has raised over $50 million from venture capital investors led by a16z. Today, large enterprises, schools and organizations – including many of the largest US tech companies and other Fortune 500 companies – use Ambient.ai to secure property, people, and assets from the most harrowing physical security threats.\r\n\r\nThe company was founded in 2017 by experts in artificial intelligence from Stanford who previously built iconic products at Apple, Google, Microsoft and Dropbox. We are backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), SV Angel, Y Combinator, and visionary angels like Jyoti Bansal, Mark Leslie and Elad Gil.",
