  "long_description": "Manifold is revolutionizing the spot freight procurement process for Carriers, Brokers, and Shippers. Our inaugural product transforms the booking process for spot shipments, significantly reducing empty miles and increasing revenue.  We do this by aggregating spot shipment opportunities from a variety of shipper and brokerage sources into a single location.\r\n\r\nAndrew and Oliver bring deep domain expertise of freight from their pivotal roles at Convoy, where they were engineering leaders automating processes that were scaled to handle over 10,000 weekly shipments. This background has been instrumental in shaping Manifold's innovative approach.\r\n\r\nIn just two months since launching Manifold has achieved $5,100 in monthly revenue, showcasing the pressing demand for our product. Manifold is poised to transform this $100+ billion industry. Not only will we streamline spot freight procurement operations but we will also redefine the industry's cost structure for the better.",
