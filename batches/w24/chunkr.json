  "long_description": "Battle-tested + highly modular vision infrastructure to convert PDFs, PPTs, Word, Excel, PNG, and JPEGs into LLM-ready data. \r\n\r\nWe started by building lumina.sh - where we needed to parse ~600M pages of scientific literature. The researchers didn't care - but devs wanted our ingestion pipeline. So we built chunkr instead. \r\n\r\nWe offer high quality layout analysis, OCR, bounding boxes, granular VLM controls, semantic chunking, and all the last mile engineering that goes into building standout AI applications. Common use-cases include RAG, and automating document workflows like invoices/medical reports -> database.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
