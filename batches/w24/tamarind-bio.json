  "long_description": "Tamarind Bio is a website and API which allows scientists to use computational biology tools at scale using a simple interface. On Tamarind, scientists can use ML models like AlphaFold to design and simulate molecules by simply selecting inputs instead of or setting up a high performance computing environment or dealing with DevOps.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur tools are used by thousands researchers in large pharma companies, top biotechs, and academic institutions. We currently focus on models in protein design and engineering, including for antibodies/therapeutics and enzymes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet in touch at founders@tamarind.bio",
