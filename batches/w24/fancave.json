  "long_description": "FanCave powers the free agency of college sports. We enable fans to pledge money to get top recruits to come to their school, or their money back.\r\n\r\nJust two years ago, it became legal for athletes to earn an income beyond their scholarships. Since then, rapid regulation change (and the NCAA's inability to enforce its own policy) has put college sports in disarray. FanCave is the first, public, legal marketplace for the massive industry of college recruiting. We help athletes safely monetize their talent, and let any fan pitch in to recruit top players.",
