  "long_description": "Fluently is an app that helps non-native professionals improve their English with instant feedback after each Zoom call. Imagine having a personal coach, always listening and providing tips.\r\n\r\nThere are 84 million non-native employees who work in English-speaking environments, and companies spend $10 billion annually solely on their English corporate training to improve communication efficiency across the company and help them grow and feel more confident.\r\n\r\nFluently offers a more efficient and convenient way to boost speaking skills by providing feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary after each call and fine-tuning the learning trajectory over time. That became possible by recent advancements in ML and the power of M1 chips for local processing.\r\n\r\nWe are non-native founders who solve their pain, and have deep expertise in running ML on edge devices.",
