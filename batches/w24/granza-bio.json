  "long_description": "Granza Bio is a biotechnology company developing a novel delivery \"shell\" platform to direct therapeutic cargo to specific tissues. Their proprietary delivery vehicles are designed using non-immunogenic proteins equipped with a targeting receptor, achieving targeted tropism to organs of interest. These vehicles offer higher stability than conventional lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and can encompass a variety of cargo, including proteins, DNA, and RNA.  \r\n\r\nFor their lead candidate, Granza Bio is leveraging the discovery of the immune system's powerful suite of weapons, \"attack particles\". Utilizing their advanced delivery platform, they aim to target these \"attack particles\" against a range of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infections.   \r\n \r\nInterested to know more?
