  "long_description": "Weâ€™re building the first generative ai-powered simulation engine, where non-technical creators can generate realistic characters powered by LLMs, 3D worlds, and interaction code/scripts with just prompts. The future of user-generated simulations, games, and interactive media will be powered by our engine.\r\n\r\nWe used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld). To the best of our knowledge, it's the first ever AI 3D simulation of a small town in real time\r\n\r\nYC Launch - https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/KeD-ego-an-ai-native-3d-simulation-engine-getting-us-closer-to-the-matrix-one-pixel-at-a-time\r\n\r\nDemo video: https://docsend.com/view/mzf6i7kiwkkgg669\r\n\r\nAI 3D TownWorld video: https://docsend.com/view/ig6t2shuz26z7wha",
