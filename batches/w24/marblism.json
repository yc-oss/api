  "long_description": "We've built several businesses over the years, and each time, we faced the same challenges. We knew we needed to send sales emails, post regularly on social media, keep an eye on Google Ads, or simply manage the endless flood of emails—but somehow, these tasks always slipped through the cracks. The intention was there, but reality always got in the way.\r\n\r\nThat's why we created Marblism: AI Employees who seamlessly handle the tasks you keep putting off. No complex setups or prompts needed—just tell them about your business once and let them work quietly in the background. Suddenly, those tasks you knew you should be doing actually get done, giving you more time and mental clarity to focus on what truly matters.",
