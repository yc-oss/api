  "long_description": "Argon AI is a platform where biopharma and life sciences professionals can execute complex and data driven workflows using natural language. We help professionals get thorough answers to questions about clinical trials, existing treatments, healthcare landscape, and the competitive market in minutes rather than months. \r\n\r\nPrior to starting Argon, Samy was responsible for Flatiron Healthâ€™s (Roche) first data analytics project which eventually led to the start of the Flatiron Services business unit. There, he saw first-hand the heavily manual process that biopharma companies struggle through to get the insights they need to drive forward their drug development programs. He also helped close over $6M+ in ARR and is an expert in enterprise pharma sales.\r\n\r\nCyrus previously led engineering teams and built 0 to 1 across pre-seed and unicorn startups, managed mission-critical trade generation systems at Bridgewater, and held AI advisory roles at various startups. Cyrus has a duel degree in EE and CS from USC.\r\n\r\nBreakthroughs in AI present an opportunity to reinvent biopharma and life science workflows to reduce the time and cost of bringing treatments to patients where delays in bringing a drug to market can cost a pharma company $3M / day.",
