  "long_description": "Astro Mechanica is reinventing supersonic aircraft by innovating on engine, airframe, and systems that industry hasn’t in over 50 years. Our electric combined cycle engine, Duality, is the world’s first jet engine that's engineered for efficiency from takeoff to Mach 3+. This new propulsion technology enables the delivery of people and payloads anywhere on Earth in just hours, laying the foundation for a new operational paradigm: an affordable point-to-point global travel network that will make on-demand, high-speed air transport the new standard of travel.",
