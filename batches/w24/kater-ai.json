  "long_description": "1. You explain your problem.\r\n2. Kater identifies the most important data questions to ask.\r\n3. Kater writes the code.\r\n4. You get insights in seconds rather than weeks.\r\n\r\nKater.ai flips the script on enterprise analytics by making every user an expert analyst. It uses a continuous classification engine to turn a single business question into a contextualized package of questions that is specific to your needs.\r\n\r\nKater puts the power of data into the hands of business experts while ensuring they use trusted data that is specific to their persona. No more waiting for data analysts. No more wasted time on analysis misfires and rework.\r\n\r\nYvonne was a data engineer and analyst who built the entire data stack at CREXi. Robin led engineering in Microsoft.  \r\n\r\n\r\nData is the new oil. Companies are data-rich, insight-poor. We're helping companies become insight-rich. This is the future of data. ",
