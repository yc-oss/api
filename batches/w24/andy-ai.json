  "long_description": "Andy is AI software that completes documentation for nurses doing home visits. Our software saves $8B a year; Tiantian was previously a PM at Google’s healthcare business and Max was a staff engineer on the health team at Apple. \r\n\r\nAndy benefits nurses and the agencies that employ them. Agencies that use Andy see up to 45% more detailed charts, 2x greater nurse productivity, and timely submission (no more billing delays!) With Andy, clinicians get their evenings back. \r\n\r\nHome health is the fastest growing segment of healthcare, doubling to $251B by 2031. Combined with recent nursing shortages and burnout, we’re seeing not just urgency, but excitement and joy, around adopting AI for home health. ",
