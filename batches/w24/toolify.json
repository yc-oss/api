  "long_description": "Toolify is dev-first internal tooling. At some point, companies using low-code builders hit a brick wall, and are bogged down by their limitations rather quickly.\r\n\r\nWe offer:\r\n- A starter kit with sensible defaults,\r\n- A VSCode extension which has AI that creates the internal tool for you, end to end, and,\r\n- A web app where you can deploy your tools.\r\n\r\nThis gives you the best of both worlds -- everything you need to build tools just as fast as low-code, and an escape hatch when you need it.",
