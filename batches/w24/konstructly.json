  "long_description": "Konstructly is the first piece of software for general contractors which ties payments to work approvals. It makes it possible to accurately assess what's been built on site and how much should be paid. \r\n\r\nKonstructly prevents overspend in construction by bridging the gap between those responsible for the payments in construction (back office) and those responsible for completing and managing the build (production). \r\n\r\n\r\nWe digitise invoicing and payment approvals and connect them to the respective quality checks of the works, trade handovers and live progress. All of which are currently managed by unlinked, separate processes and data structures. \r\n\r\nThe visibility we provide not only streamlines manual processes and allows much better schedule and payment management, it also incentivises productivity from subcontractors to ensure they get paid on time, in full.
