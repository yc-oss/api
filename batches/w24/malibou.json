  "long_description": "malibou is a web application helping French SMBs to manage employees, run payroll and track compliance in a single app.\r\n\r\nWhen processing payroll in France, you either have the choice between an accountant with good advice but no way to connect an HRIS with him, or a good HRIS that does not include payroll services. It was time for a change, to finally bring payroll and HR at the same place. \r\n\r\nDue to increasing competition in the space, French payroll engines have just opened their APIs. This allows us to offer a unified payroll and HR solution, which wasn't possible before.",
