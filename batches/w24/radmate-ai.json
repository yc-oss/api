  "long_description": "We’re building the AI copilot for radiologists, powered by a foundational model for medical imaging. RadMate AI will read radiology images and generate full reports for radiologists to review and submit.\r\n\r\nMohamed and Adam are technical co-founders who met while studying Computer Science at Cornell University. Before starting RadMate AI to solve the problems his dad faced as a radiologist, Adam worked at Palantir on the initial launch of Palantir’s Al Platform. Mohamed has experience at AWS, where his goal was to help enterprises innovate on the cloud, and PathAl, where he worked on their image viewer platform to improve the workflow of pathologists. ",
