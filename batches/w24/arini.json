  "long_description": "Arini is the AI receptionist for dentists that answers phone calls, and schedules appointments. Most dental appointments are scheduled over the phone by overworked receptionists who put patients on hold and miss a third of incoming calls. This costs clinics a 15% loss in revenue.\r\n\r\nPrivate equity investment fueled large dental groups to acquire thousands of clinics in the past few years. We are selling to these groups, since their clinics have a standardized tech stack. Theyâ€™re also growing really fast - in just two years they will make up 40% of the US dental market.\r\n\r\nDental is just the beginning.",
