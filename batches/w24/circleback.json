  "long_description": "Circleback helps teams get the most out of every meeting–whether it's on Zoom, Google Meet, Slack huddles, in-person, or any other meeting platform–by writing notes and automatically taking action on details that matter most.\r\n\r\nFor example, Circleback can automatically identify feature requests that come up in product demo calls and create Linear tasks for each of them, or update your CRM with customer details after a sales call.\r\n\r\nBefore Circleback, Ali led the first integration of LLMs into the Stripe support product and Kevin worked on predictive analytics at Tableau as a senior software engineer.",
