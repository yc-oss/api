  "long_description": "BiteSight shows users videos of food we think they will love from nearby restaurants and delivers it right to their door. \r\n\r\nZac and Lucious studied together at UT Austin. Zac did CS and AI Research, and Lucious built his first $1M ARR product while moonlighting at a YC startup at age 19.\r\n\r\nSince launching the beta in February, BiteSight has onboarded 274 restaurants in SF, handled 211 orders, and users are growing more than 50% each week, all organically.\r\n\r\nUberEats and DoorDash have become cluttered and impersonal super apps. They've created a $30B opportunity for a delivery app that puts the customer experience first by combining high-quality videos, recommendations, and social proof from your most trusted food critics - your friends.",
