  "long_description": "Centauri AI is a modern ETL and Data Science platform for banks and investment firms, starting with Structured Finance. \r\n\r\nFinancial firms heavily rely on Excel, PDF, and PPT files to exchange complex asset details, leading analysts to spend hours crunching the files and extracting insights. Moreover, these data files and reports cannot be easily reused due to poor data infrastructure. \r\n\r\nPowered by AI, our product cuts hours of data wrangling work down to minutes and makes it possible to query past data easily. This helps firms evaluate assets faster and win more deals.\r\n\r\nSince launching last month, we've started a pilot with a brokerage team at a public investment bank that now uses our product daily. Aiming to serve over 100,000 investment teams needing complex data analysis for alternative investments, this opens up a potential $5 billion market.",
