  "long_description": "Hona integrates with electronic health record systems to collect and condense medical histories, enabling providers to fully understand their patients by finding data previously lost in mountains of charts. It searches nationwide for patient data based on providers' schedules, condensing notes, lab results, and more into specialty-specific clinical summaries with links to original sources. Hona then converts its clinical summaries into value-based care metrics, risk scores, and quality measures for practice-level insights.",
