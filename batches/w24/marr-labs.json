  "long_description": "Marr Labs is making AI-voice agents that are indistinguishable from humans. Han and Dave previously created speech tech company Vlingo that powered the first Siri app and was acquired for $225M. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow they are taking voice to the next level by making AI-voice agents that can handle virtually any phone-based job, from answering calls to schedule appointments to call center sales and support jobs—all at a fraction of the cost of a human agent.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the US alone, businesses handle 17 billion calls a year at an average cost of $5 per call–an $85 billion addressable market.
