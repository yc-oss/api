  "long_description": "The fragmented and proprietary evaluation tools today are leading to significant inefficiencies and confusion among developers. The world needs a standard everyone can rely on and that is why we are building Ragas as the open-source standard. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe have 4k stars on GitHub, 1.3k members in our discord community, and over 80+ external contributors. We also have partnerships with key AI companies like Langchain, Llamaindex, Arize, Weaviate and more to help create a standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe already process 5 million evaluations monthly for engineers from companies like AWS, Microsoft, Databricks, and Moodyâ€™s and it is growing at 70% month over month.\r\n\r\nWe are building LLM application testing and evaluation infrastructure for Enterprises.\r\n",
