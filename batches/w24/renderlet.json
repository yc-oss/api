  "long_description": "renderlet is a framework that makes it easy to develop interactive applications.\r\n\r\nBuilding applications with high-performance graphics is very hard – existing tools are cumbersome and aren’t truly platform agnostic, leading to frequent rework. \r\n\r\nWith renderlet, developers can write high-level code to describe 2D and 3D graphics without having to use low-level, platform-specific APIs.\r\n\r\nrenderlet automatically compiles graphics code to WebAssembly and embeds a portable rendering engine inside any app, enabling graphics to safely and automatically render on any platform’s GPU.\r\n\r\nOur runtime is open-source: https://github.com/renderlet/wander",
