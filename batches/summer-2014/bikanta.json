  "long_description": "Bikanta is introducing revolutionary nanodiamond-based technology to push the boundaries of current medical imaging and diagnostics, allowing researchers to answer questions and medics to detect diseases that they currently cannot.\r\n\r\nA nanodiamond is forever. They are brightly fluorescent, infinitely stable, non-toxic, functionalizable and can be used for background-free optical imaging.  Early results have improved the signal by as much as 100-fold over conventional fluorescence imaging techniques.   Bikantaâ€™s vision is to redefine the boundaries of medical diagnostics by delivering cutting-edge imaging probes and background-free optical imaging.",
