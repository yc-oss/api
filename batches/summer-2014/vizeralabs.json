  "long_description": "Vizera was an augmented reality company that used projectors with depth sensors to project an AR layer onto real world objects, rather than using screens/smart glasses. \r\n\r\nOur first application was in retail where we partnered with top furniture retailers to display their selection of different fabrics/patterns by using our projectors in their smaller showrooms to improve their in store revenue. \r\n\r\nOur demo is still live on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YV8lo-OxZQ ",
