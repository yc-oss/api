  "long_description": "Etacts was born from the frustration of keeping in touch with our ever-growing list of friends (both business and personal), family, coworkers, and clients.\n\nIt's impossible to remember to stay in touch with all the people that matter. Etacts helps you maintain your relationships by doing three things:\n\n1) Showing you who you've lost touch with\n2) Letting you set reminders to stay in touch with people\n3) Helping you get back in touch meaningfully by giving you relevant context about your relationship with people, such as the last emails you exchanged, or their recent status updates.\n\nUse Etacts to build and maintain relationships with former friends, business partners, clients, and more!",
