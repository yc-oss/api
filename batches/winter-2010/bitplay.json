Meet with a client, a customer, your project team or your co-workers in person without ever leaving your desk by simply creating a tiny meeting room link and sharing the link with anyone you want to meet with.\n\nYou can re-use your meeting room as many times as you want and you can have people drop in and out of the your room anytime. Because there's no sign ups or user registration needed to drop into a meeting room you can use Meetings.io as an online hangout for real time in person hangouts or as a telepresence system to attend meetings remotely.",
