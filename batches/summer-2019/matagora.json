  "long_description": "At Matagora, our team brings over a decade of retail experience. Our mission is to empower independent retailers with the tools they need to compete with big box stores and effectively level out the playing field. One of the biggest challenges we see is staffing — many retailers struggle to maintain consistent, reliable, and properly trained team members to handle back-office tasks, marketing, ecommerce, POS management, and basic tech know-how.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we offer affordable, ecommerce expertise as a service. Retailers no longer have to worry about high turnover, constant retraining, or trying to learn everything themselves. Instead, they can stay focused on what they love: curating great products and delivering an amazing in-store experience — while we handle the rest. And since it’s a simple expense, it’s easy to plan for and write off, too.",
