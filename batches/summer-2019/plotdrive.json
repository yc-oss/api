  "long_description": "Plotdrive is the first continuous production system for narrative — infrastructure that transforms how long-form stories move from imagination to completion. Most books don’t fail for lack of talent; they fail when the workflow collapses somewhere between page 80 and page 300.\r\n\r\nFounded by brothers with backgrounds in high-stakes poker, VR, and narrative systems, we built what we couldn’t find: an engine that holds the entire shape of a story while authors work inside it. Writers see 5-10× gains in throughput without losing their voice. Manuscripts that sat untouched for years finally reach the finish line. Authors are using Plotdrive to break decade-long blocks. Publishers are using it to rethink how story pipelines should operate when continuity, context, and editorial craft can finally scale.\r\n\r\nThe printing press made distribution industrial. We’re making completion industrial — creating the foundational layer for how narrative gets made at scale.",
