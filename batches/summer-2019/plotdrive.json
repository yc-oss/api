  "long_description": "We're building the world's first AI that actually remembers your entire book - an intelligent writing companion that transforms how stories get finished. Our mission is to solve the #1 reason books die unfinished: writers losing track of their own stories across hundreds of pages. Founded by brothers who've pushed creative boundaries across poker, VR gaming, and interactive storytelling, we combine deep technical expertise with an obsessive focus on what writers actually need. Our CEO, a former world-class poker player, brings the same strategic depth that won millions to ensuring every writer can finally type \"The End.\" We're a team of rebellious optimists who've already helped authors break through decade-long blocks and publish books they thought would never see the light of day. The printing press gave stories reach. We're giving them wings.",
