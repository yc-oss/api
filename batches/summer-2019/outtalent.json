  "long_description": "Outtalent helps top engineers from emerging markets get jobs abroad at companies like Google.\r\n\r\nWe started Outtalent because we believe that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not and emerging markets have an exceptional number of great but undervalued engineers. We believe getting a job at one of the world’s best companies sets people on a great path to realize their full potential.\r\n\r\nOuttalent is funded by YCombinator, world-class venture capital funds, executives from Google and Facebook, and other angel investors who are passionate about our mission. We have already helped software engineers from Russia, Ukraine and Central Asia get jobs at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and many other companies in the US, Canada, and Europe.",
