  "long_description": "Rutter is the unified API infrastructure powering the next generation of B2B fintech. We help tech-forward companies build seamlessly integrated financial products by connecting to their customers' systems of record, from accounting platforms to e-commerce systems.\r\n\r\nThe financial operations landscape is fragmented across hundreds of platforms (QuickBooks, NetSuite, Shopify, Stripe, etc.). Without Rutter, companies must spend thousands of engineering hours building and maintaining these critical integrations.\r\n\r\nOur Universal API provides the same level of granularity as direct integrations while using a single, consistent schema. This enables our customers to build end-to-end workflows for financial planning, lending, expense management, AP/AR automation, and more, in days, not months.\r\n\r\nLeading fintechs like Mercury, Airwallex, and Orb trust Rutter to power their integrated financial solutions.\r\n\r\nLearn more: https://www.rutter.com/",
