  "long_description": "UX teams are scaling exponentially, but in order to scale effectively, they need to be able to reuse each other’s work. The problem is that right now, UX designers and developers don’t know what’s been done before and they end up rebuilding the same things – over and over. zeroheight integrates with UX tools and allows teams to document their work, so that it can be reused and they can deliver UX faster.",
