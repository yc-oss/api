A drawer overlay is added on top of your site that makes it easy for your reviewers to take screenshots with annotations, capture screen recordings, leave comments, create tickets on popular bug-tracking platforms, and more. You get this functionality just by deploying to FeaturePeek â€” no dependencies or code changes needed.",
