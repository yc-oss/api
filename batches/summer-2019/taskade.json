  "long_description": "Taskade is the execution layer for ideas. One prompt becomes a live app — websites, dashboards, workflows, portals, or tools. Your workspace is the backend. Every project is a live database. Every workflow is automated. AI agents act, plan, and learn across your workspace. Everything syncs in real time.\r\n\r\nNo code. No gatekeepers. Just build. Creation becomes instant. Apps become alive and adapt as your data and team evolve. Anyone can build, automate, and deploy their ideas with Taskade—available on web, desktop, and mobile.\r\n\r\nSoftware should be built by everyone. Build without permission.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.taskade.com",
