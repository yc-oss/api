Build live dashboards, websites, and tools that connect with your workspace in real time.\r\n\r\nEvery workflow automates itself.\r\nEvery project becomes a live database.\r\nEvery agent plans, acts, and learns inside your workspace.\r\n\r\nNo code. No setup. Just creation.\r\n\r\nTaskade Genesis turns work into living systems.\r\nProjects remember. Agents learn. Automations keep everything in motion.\r\nBuild once, and your workspace evolves as your data and team grow.\r\n\r\nYour workspace is the backend. The interface builds itself.\r\nSoftware should be built by everyone.\r\nBuild without permission.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.taskade.com",
