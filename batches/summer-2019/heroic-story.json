  "long_description": "We're building the world's first true Author OS - an intelligent engine that will transform how stories are created, shared, and loved. Our mission is to give storytellers superpowers, removing every barrier between imagination and reality through AI. Founded by brothers who've pushed creative boundaries across VR gaming, Twitch streaming, and Hollywood, we combine deep technical expertise with an innate understanding of what makes stories work. Our CEO, a former world-class poker player, brings the same strategic depth and calculated boldness that won millions to our mission of empowering creators. We're a team of rebellious optimists who believe we're standing at the threshold of storytelling's next great evolution. The printing press gave stories reach. We're giving them wings.",
