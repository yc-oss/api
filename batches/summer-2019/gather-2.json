  "long_description": "Gather is a video chat platform designed to make virtual interactions more human. Our mission is to create opportunity and connection for everyone, no matter where they are. We do this by building the Metaverse, a virtual layer over the physical world where people can work, socialize, and learn. \r\n\r\nSince we launched in May of 2020, Gather has brought millions of people together. We have raised a total of $77 million in Series A and B from Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, and more. Weâ€™re a small, friendly team based out of a state-of-the-art virtual office, where you can work whenever and wherever suits you. Come join us!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90692692/gather-inclusive-metaverse-vr",
