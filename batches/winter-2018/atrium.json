  "long_description": "Atrium is a new kind of law firm. We serve the startup community in ways our clients want to be served. We are organized like a modern business. We incentivize our teamâ€™s creativity and productivity through good management, not the billable hour. We build software to drive efficiency and transparency in our work. We achieve these differences through a technology and operations platform called Atrium LTS, which we co-founded with leading serial entrepreneurs and software developers who share our vision to fix the corporate legal practice.\r\n\r\nPlease find open jobs here: https://www.atrium.co/careers/",
