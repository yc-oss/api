We’re a deeply technical team who value humility and customer empathy above all. As a group we’re also pretty good at bowling, D&D, and Rubik’s cubes.\r\n\r\nWe are building an advanced analytics platform with the challenge of making it accessible to a smart, capable clientele of growth experts that demands ease of use, utility, high availability and good responsiveness. You’ll join a startup environment where you'll be exposed to a variety of backend, frontend, machine learning frameworks in a fast-moving company!",
