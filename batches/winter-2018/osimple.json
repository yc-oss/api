  "long_description": "OSIMple automates data entry for inspectors by replacing stacks of paper with tablets and by generating completed inspection forms. This saves inspectors almost half of their inspection time. Founder Amanda Chan and Michael Miller came across the idea while talking to friends and professors in the civil engineering department at their university. They started building better software for bridge inspectors who were using very manual processes, and it’s been used on over 400 bridges so far. They’ve recently expanded to service home inspectors as well.\r\n\r\nRobust, easy to use software and committed team of self-starters providing fast and reliable customer service. We are chalk full of Software Engineering expertise and ready to automate routine inspection tasks to let you focus on meaningful work.",
