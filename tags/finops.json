We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers.

Historically, it’s been difficult to improve this process because it’s heavily reliant on manual emails, disparate systems, and inconsistently structured data. However, the advent of powerful AI technology allows us to unlock greater automation than ever before. TradeFlow empowers back offices to do more with less by offloading these time-intensive tasks to AI.",
