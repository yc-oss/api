Our mission is to end this manual toil.\r\n\r\nWe learned this domain first-hand at Stripe and Airbnb, where first we built software for human reviewers, and then built models to replace them.\r\n\r\nWe’re a group of engineers from Stripe, Meta, Netflix, MIT, and Princeton that love language models and unironically love B2B SaaS. We know the economy is going to be rearranged over the next 4 years and we want to be in the driver’s seat.\r\n\r\nWe build vertical AI that works and have some of the world’s largest companies as paying customers.
