It’s super important work, but the jobs are difficult and sometimes traumatizing, and it’s impossible to keep up. Our mission is to end this manual toil.\r\n\r\nWe learned this domain first-hand at Stripe and Airbnb, where first we built software for human reviewers, and then built models to replace them.\r\n\r\nWe’re a group of engineers from Stripe, Meta, Netflix, MIT, and Princeton that love language models and unironically love B2B SaaS. We know the economy is going to be rearranged over the next 4 years and we want to be in the driver’s seat.\r\n\r\nWe build vertical AI that works and have some of the world’s largest companies as paying customers. Patreon, Eventbrite, Upwork, Character.ai, Substack, Faire, along with a $10B+ marketplace, a $100B+ payments company, and more rely on SafetyKit in production.",

    "long_description": "As autonomy moves into complex safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation), failures become more costly and companies must devote significant in-house effort to validate their system before real-world deployment. Valgo accelerates autonomous systems development and certification by providing tooling to perform algorithmic safety validation at scale. We are building a platform to efficiently find rare and realistic failure events in simulation at a fraction of the compute cost required by existing approaches. Our tools are agnostic to models/simulators (i.e., black box) and can be applied across industries such as autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance.\r\n\r\nValgo was founded by Stanford PhDs who wrote the textbook and taught the course at Stanford on algorithmic safety validation. We also have significant industry experience working on an FAA-certified collision avoidance system at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, validating autonomous aircraft at Xwing, and collaborating with industry sponsors across transportation, aviation, and energy.",
