But the vendor community has responded with hard-to-use, hard-to-implement, and hard-to-purchase private sector software rather than building something from the ground up. These outdated solutions fail to address government workers’ unique challenges. \n\nSeneca Systems was founded to address those challenges and strengthen the vital bond between government and people. Our Constituent Services Platform, Romulus, centralizes constituent communications, organizes service requests, and provides insights into constituent preferences and work performed. Built for governments by people who love government workers, Romulus enables government workers to get more done in less time, with less overhead, and to more constituent applause.",

We contribute by building software to streamline local government tax assessors’ workflows using AI. Specifically, we streamline the change of ownership process for real estate and create more seamless ways for tax offices to communicate digitally with their taxpayers.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, when properties get bought and sold, local governments have to process reams of paper in order to update their systems and perform the analyses necessary to update the tax roll. Our software makes this process 10x faster and much more enjoyable for employees in the tax office to complete, and creates trust and goodwill in the minds of taxpayers. ",

In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they’ve been in decades.  \r\n\r\nAs fellows in Stanford’s Center for National Security Innovation, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, we’ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.\r\n",

As the Chief of Staff, he witnessed first-hand the tedious process of finding great contract opportunities, the lengthy solicitation preparation process, and paper-based communication between departments.\r\n\r\nHe teamed up with Ben and Maciej, whom he met during Berkeley's M.E.T. admit day. Both of them had extensive experience in AI research and applications, which they applied to creating a powerful framework for humans and AI agents to collaborate during the lifecycle of a contract.\r\n\r\nWith SalesPatriot, your firm can run on autopilot - we find suitable contracts automatically, ingest RFQs from primes, streamline the communication between the departments, and provide analytics to improve your win rate.\r\n\r\nWether you are a manufacturer, reseller, or distributor, SalesPatriot can reduce your manual tasks, increase throughput, and boost your revenue.
