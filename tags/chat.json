New flows launch in minutes and reach respondents over your preferred channel or embedded chat. We guide the exchange, follow up automatically, and return clean structured data without extra work from your team.\r\n\r\nForms power billions of business interactions yearly. Whether it’s forms for client intake, registrations, compliance, feedback, or surveys, they all follow the same painful pattern: low conversion, messy data, and frustrated users. Teams have long tolerated forms only because there's been no scalable alternative for collecting structured information from people - until now. Our goal is for RowFlow to become the new default way for how organizations collect user data in an AI-first world.",

It's a thinking partner that lets you instantly search your entire history of ideas, synthesize them into new insights, and watch your knowledge build on itself over time.\r\n\r\nRight now, your best thinking is trapped in ephemeral AI chat histories. Nessie unifies your context from ChatGPT, Claude, and (soon) Apple Notes/Google Docs/Notion/other context sources, auto-organizing the mess into an AI-enhanced brain.\r\n\r\nNext, we are unlocking sharing. Instead of sending a static doc, you will be able to send your \"Product Strategy Brain\" to a cofounder, or publish your \"Research Brain\" for your entire team to chat with.\r\n\r\nWho it's for: AI-native thinkers—founders, researchers, and writers—who believe their best ideas should compound.\r\n\r\nThe Team: We are two Yale CS grads and former Amazon engineers building the tool we needed for ourselves. We combine Anna's obsession with neuroscience and augmenting human cognition with Tiger's lifelong passion for building products (he shipped an app with 70k+ users at age 13).\r\n\r\nTraction: Launched 3 weeks ago. We have over 1,200 users who have imported 300,000+ AI conversations into Nessie. 30% week-over-week organic user growth.\r\n\r\nOrigin Story: Nessie was born after we hit the 1-million-token limit in multiple Gemini chats. Overnight, months of research disappeared. We realized the problem wasn't just about storage; it was that the medium for AI-native thought didn't exist yet. The chat window is a place to ask questions, not a place to build a mind.\r\n\r\nOur Vision: We are building a new medium for personal intelligence. Everyone will have an AI brain on Nessie. You will use it to think better, remember more, and share your mind with the world.",
