    "long_description": "## What is Yuma AI?\r\n\r\nYuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify brands deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 80% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",
