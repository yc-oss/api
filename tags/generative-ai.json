Zoko solves this by seamlessly integrating WhatsApp commerce capabilities with your existing Shopify infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTHE UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY THAT'S COSTING YOU SALES\r\nConsider this: 175 million people message businesses on WhatsApp daily - that's more engagement than Amazon generates. With 100 million merchants already using WhatsApp for business globally, those not leveraging this channel are falling behind competitors who are capturing sales directly through conversations.\r\n\r\nPROVEN SUCCESS FORMULA\r\nZoko's founders didn't just theorize about WhatsApp commerce - they lived it. Starting with their own ecommerce business entirely on WhatsApp, they scaled to 200,000 engaged followers who eagerly purchased products through weekly WhatsApp updates. When other businesses began paying for access to their \"WhatsApp sales tools,\" they knew they'd discovered something revolutionary.\r\n\r\nTHE $50 BILLION MARKET OPPORTUNITY\r\nThe WhatsApp commerce market represents over $50 billion annually - a massive revenue stream that traditional ecommerce platforms can't access. For Shopify merchants, this means untapped customers, higher engagement rates, and sales happening through the world's most trusted messaging platform.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE SALES, MARKETING & SUPPORT INTEGRATION\r\nZoko transforms WhatsApp into a comprehensive business channel, enabling Shopify merchants to:\r\n- Convert conversations directly into sales\r\n- Run targeted marketing campaigns through WhatsApp\r\n- Provide instant customer support where customers prefer to communicate\r\n- Build deeper customer relationships through personalized messaging\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF COMMERCE IS CONVERSATIONAL\r\nWhatsApp represents the internet for the next billion users entering the digital economy. Zoko positions itself as the \"Shopify for WhatsApp merchants,\" giving existing Shopify store owners the tools to dominate this emerging channel before competitors realize its potential.\r\n\r\nFor Shopify merchants serious about growth, Zoko isn't just another tool - it's the bridge to the next generation of ecommerce where conversations convert to sales.",

We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM like Clearbit, 6sense, Demandbase), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\nThis is why RevOps, sales, growth, recruiting, and outbound teams choose us to power their AI SDR platforms (examples of these platforms that could use Fiber AI include artisan ai, 11x, amplemarket, reply.io, unify gtm, penguin ai, regie ai, aisdr, artisan sdr, outreach io, and warmly ai - many of these have used or currently use us), existing lead databases (email enrichment, bulk email finder, or phone enrichment tools like apollo, zoominfo, leadIQ), and contact enrichment tools (clay, persana ai) that promise automation and enrichment but deliver poor results.",

Parents are tired of overstimulating, low-value content from YouTube and Netflix. Pixley gives them safe and personalized stories that encourage learning and imagination.\r\n\r\nBut kids’ cartoons are just the beginning. As video generation improves, all video content will shift from manual production to being personalized and generated. Our long-term goal is to build the AI Netflix: a platform where shows and movies aren’t recommended, but instead generated around each viewer’s interests and habits.\r\n\r\nWe’re 19 year old CS dropouts who’ve known each other since elementary school and won 4 hackathons at 15. After seeing AI flood the internet with low-quality content, we created Pixley – a safe, personalized way for kids to turn their ideas into animated stories.",

    "long_description": "Ritivel turns raw clinical trial data into FDA submission documents in minutes. Traditionally, medical writers spend 8-12 weeks manually compiling data; our system uses study protocol and statistical outputs to instantly generate these reports with full traceability to the source data.\r\n\r\nClinical development is pharma's biggest bottleneck. Despite rising R&D, trial timelines have increased 33% over the last decade. Accelerating clinical timelines by 20% unlocks hundreds of millions in additional revenue per drug by extending patent life. \r\n\r\nGeneric AI fails in pharma due to a lack of traceability, with only 28% of pilots reaching production - the FDA requires traceability for all claims. Our proprietary engine solves this with word-level traceability, linking every generated sentence to clinical evidence. We deploy 100% on-premise to keep sensitive patient data within the client's infrastructure, making us a trusted AI partner for pharma.\r\n\r\nWe automate the most complex parts of CSRs (clinical narratives and biostatistical analysis). Our high-quality output, validated by senior regulatory writers, costs 1/100th of human writing. We're built by experts from Microsoft, Kearney, and IQVIA - combining deep AI engineering with regulatory expertise to solve the \"last mile\" of drug development—a problem generic AI wrappers can't solve because they don't understand the standards or FDA requirements.",
