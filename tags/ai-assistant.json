    "long_description": "Tenyks (YC S21) is a Cambridge University spin-out building the World's Most Versatile Visual Intelligence Platform—think Snowflake for Vision or GPT for Video.\r\n\r\nProblem: Companies today collect oceans of visual data (from cameras, drones, and satellites), but struggle to extract actionable insights. Current solutions rely heavily on manual analysis by call centres in locations like the Philippines or AI platforms narrowly focused on security rather than deeper operational insights. This leaves critical improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth unrealised.\r\n\r\nSolution: Tenyks unlocks unprecedented insights by applying advanced multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of comprehensive video summarisation, retrieval, and visual question-answering. These VLMs are seamlessly combined with specialised analytics for emotion detection, activity recognition, object tracking, and even gait analysis. Our platform transforms ordinary visual footage into extraordinary operational intelligence.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus: Starting with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), we enable operations leaders to instantly understand customer flow, kitchen efficiency, staff productivity, and quality of service using their existing security camera footage—turning previously inaccessible data into direct operational improvements and clear financial ROI. For instance, insights from Tenyks can accelerate the speed of service significantly; even a 1-second improvement in service speed could generate $30,000 additional annual revenue per restaurant. For a multi-unit owner of 100 restaurants, that's an additional $3 million per year.\r\n\r\nTraction: We've recently secured our first Fortune 500 customer, joining other major enterprises, global system integrators, and high-growth startups trusting Tenyks for powerful, data-driven decision-making.\r\n\r\nWhy Tenyks: Our patented technology originates from the founders' PhD research at Cambridge University. Previously, we helped world-leading teams scale high-performing Vision AI in production. \r\n\r\nRecognition: Recognised as a Rising Star in Gen AI by Sifted, Best Product of the Year by Vision AI Alliance, and Company of the Year by Cambridge University (previously awarded to DeepMind).",

Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results.\r\n\r\nArgovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale. Through both voice and text conversations, our AI agents can engage in complex, multi-turn patient billing and collection conversation.

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify brands deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 80% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality. \r\n\r\nThe idea was born out of Abdullah's experience as a mechanical design team member, where he created thousands of drawings and longed for a more efficient process. Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",
