Unlike legacy MDM or “after-the-fact” compliance software, Swif.ai delivers enforcement—not just reports—plus device-level Shadow IT/AI governance to detect and block risky or unauthorized SaaS and LLM tools.\r\n\r\nEnterprises choose Swif.ai for true multi-OS coverage in a single pane of glass, one-click remediation, and fast time-to-value via silent installers and native integrations with Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace (conditional access by device posture). The result is fewer tools to manage, shorter audits, and stronger security with lower operational burden. Swif.ai is SOC 2 Type II.

If the company already has written security policies, they can upload those documents, too. From there, Stacksi parses their documents, identifies gaps in their security policies vs. standards, and helps them establish a successful security program. \r\nUltimately, we will help them 1) automate completion of security questionnaires, 2) quickly get through enterprise security audits and 3) improve their security posture.",

Traditionally, medical writers spend 8-12 weeks manually compiling data; our system uses study protocol and statistical outputs to instantly generate these reports with full traceability to the source data.\r\n\r\nClinical development is pharma's biggest bottleneck. Despite rising R&D, trial timelines have increased 33% over the last decade. Accelerating clinical timelines by 20% unlocks hundreds of millions in additional revenue per drug by extending patent life. \r\n\r\nGeneric AI fails in pharma due to a lack of traceability, with only 28% of pilots reaching production - the FDA requires traceability for all claims. Our proprietary engine solves this with word-level traceability, linking every generated sentence to clinical evidence. We deploy 100% on-premise to keep sensitive patient data within the client's infrastructure, making us a trusted AI partner for pharma.\r\n\r\nWe automate the most complex parts of CSRs (clinical narratives and biostatistical analysis). Our high-quality output, validated by senior regulatory writers, costs 1/100th of human writing. We're built by experts from Microsoft, Kearney, and IQVIA - combining deep AI engineering with regulatory expertise to solve the \"last mile\" of drug development—a problem generic AI wrappers can't solve because they don't understand the standards or FDA requirements.",
