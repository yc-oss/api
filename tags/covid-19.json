    "long_description": "PreDxion Bio is working on a rapid saliva-based antigen test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients. Our technology is uniquely capable of being scaled to 10's of millions of tests of days using semiconductor fab processes, a scale of testing necessary to better inform public health officials and policymakers and enable contact tracing at scale.\r\n\r\nPreDxion Bio's origins are in critical care: our original technology is a rapid, near real-time cytokine and biomarker detection platform to monitor the immune response of critically-ill patients. This technology leverages a novel sensor platform we spun out of the University of Michigan. PreDxion Bio has received FDA Breakthrough Device designation and partnered with top pharmcos to monitor the immune response following CAR-T therapy and predict the development of cytokine release syndrome and neurological AEs, and for use in guiding precision medicine approaches in critical care.",

Our patented tech also meets performance requirements for medical diagnoses and integrates with the current healthcare tech stack. Scout’s technology is poised to disrupt the outdated $33Bn diagnostic market by democratizing testing while dramatically improving the patient experience.\r\n\r\nScout has received $16M in non-dilutive funding from the NIH and other organizations to fully de-risk our platform, and our pipeline includes a diverse test menu for primary care (e.g. respiratory and sexual health), wellness (e.g. gut health), and chronic conditions (e.g. certain cancers). We have already received FDA authorization for our platform in clinical settings and are planning to launch our flagship Scout Hub in 2024.",
