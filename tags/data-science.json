We believe trading is one of the best domains to train models to develop research taste and intuition based on real-world continuous feedback. We're building the infrastructure to make this happen.\r\n\r\nSam's ex-girlfriend introduced him to Greg back at Carnegie Mellon in 2017, and while that relationship didn't last, their friendship has.

We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\r\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\r\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds. Git and branching are built-in for both code and data, so you can time-travel backwards when things break. You can start with GBs and grow to TBs.",
