    "long_description": "Neptune is an observability startup that offers one-stop incident enrichment and automation platform for IT Operations and DevOps teams.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of life that servers and applications go down causing IT outages. Today most of the IT incident response is manual, tedious and lengthy resulting in more downtime and losses for businesses. At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

Currently, we are focused on helping radiology AI teams prepare high-quality datasets to train their algorithms.\r\n\r\nRadiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI\r\n\r\nWe're a team based out of Bangalore India, and USA. We're backed by leading institutional investors like Y Combinator and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India). ",

This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

We’re not a generic annotation vendor—we’re your on-demand evaluation and safety data engine. In under a minute, you can spin up your own data-annotation workspace tailored to your workflow, so your team can move from “we think it works” to measurable, repeatable results. \r\n\r\nModern AI changes quickly. Models evolve, prompts shift, and new edge cases appear the moment you go live. Besimple is built for that reality. Our platform generates task-specific annotation experiences aligned to your data and goals, so you can capture reliable judgment on everything from factuality and safety to preference and policy compliance. The result is an always-current evaluation loop that keeps pace with your product, rather than a one-off test that goes stale. \r\n\r\nWe specialize in evaluation and expert-grade safety data—not commodity labeling. That means we recruit and train domain experts and SMEs to judge model outputs against high bars, and we design the interfaces and guidelines to make those judgments consistent, auditable, and useful for both offline evals and production monitoring. \r\n\r\nYour team shouldn’t be waiting on back-and-forth specs and custom tooling. With Besimple, you can paste or stream your data, click to generate a tailored interface, and start collecting ground truth right away. When the task changes, the UI adapts with it. \r\n\r\nWe combine pragmatic product design with a human-in-the-loop operating model. Besimple helps you create clear, actionable guidelines and then enforces them with workflow guardrails, reviewer consensus, and targeted spot-checks—so you can trust the numbers you ship. Because we’re built for iterative work, teams can quickly compare prompts, models, and policies; spot regressions; and push fixes backed by fresh, expert-reviewed data. \r\n\r\nGreat models don’t happen by accident—they’re the product of tight feedback loops, expert judgment, and tooling that bends to your data, not the other way around. If you’re ready to replace slow, one-size-fits-all processes with a purpose-built evaluation and safety engine, Besimple gives you the fastest path from raw data to reliable decisions—so you can iterate boldly and ship with confidence.",

Unsafe actions, whether it’s a rogue DROP TABLE or a payment above policy limits, are blocked before they touch production. Behind the scenes, Alter manages credentials, issuing ephemeral, scope-narrowed access for every interaction, then rotating or expiring it in seconds. The result: no long-lived secrets, no blind spots, and no surprises in audit.\r\n\r\nWith Alter, teams can move fast on AI agent initiatives while staying fully compliant with SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and internal security standards. A CISO-ready dashboard delivers real-time visibility, detailed audit logs, and compliance-ready controls, removing silos, eliminating excessive permissions, and providing complete oversight of every agent workflow.",
