    "long_description": "At Extern, we’re solving the experience gap.  Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship.  Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time.  Since 2020, we’ve created and powered Externships for over 50,000 students on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and they’re time-consuming for employers to run.\r\n\r\nExternships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern.  Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students.\r\n\r\nBy making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy.  We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education – no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status.  Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship.\r\n\r\nExtern was born out of a pivot from Paragon One (W17) which initially focused on providing students with a career center-as-a-service platform, connecting them with industry professionals to receive career coaching and guidance.  Backed by Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, Launch Fund, University Ventures, and Learn Capital.",

In order for companies to win the war for talent, they need to provide a best-in-class candidate experience to recruit top talent, and our product aims at doing just that!\r\n\r\nOur founders Lydia Han (CEO) and Chris Triolo (CTO) both founded ModernLoop in December of 2020 after they saw the challenges recruiting teams had when it came to coordinating hundreds of interviews across various teams, all while making sure both hiring managers and candidates had the best experience possible. After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

Covid and Brexit ceased the usual oversupply of candidates, making traditional job boards unable to meet employers' needs, and agencies more expensive than ever. As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",

Hiring managers and recruiters end up taking a robotic, brute force approach to sourcing - the kind of approach top talent hates.\r\n\r\nManagers are increasingly finding that the simplest and most personable way to attract talent starts with their network. The best candidates want to work for great people, not faceless companies. Sharing open roles on places like LinkedIn, Slack, and Twitter unlocks enormous potential for a personalized recruiting approach across a curated talent pool, but these referrals are difficult to track across platforms and end up lost in the shuffle.

Our 16+ provider waterfalls deliver high quality emails and phone numbers, and we offer a 0% email bounce guarantee, making this a risk-free offer for customers (something that Apollo.io, Clay.com, Hunter.io, People Data Labs, LeadMagic, Prospeo, FindyMail, Wiza, Icypeas, FullEnrich, Datagma, Dropcontact, and others can't and won't ever offer).\r\n\r\nThe problem with AI sales copilots and AI sales automation is that they can't build targeted lists. Success in modern sales requires niche, surgical targeting - then executing personalized outbound across multiple channels. That's where Fiber AI excels.\r\n\r\nOur platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, building precise lists that AI SDRs can't match (replaces broad AI BDR spraying, unfocused AI sales automation, and lead generation software). We are able to filter on things like:\r\n\r\n1) Headcount Growth Tracking: Find scaling companies with monthly, quarterly, yearly employee growth metrics\r\n2) Deep Filtering: Fundraising history, Ivy League alumni search, promotion patterns, office expansions\r\n3) Intent Signals: Open jobs data, hiring patterns, technographic filters, company metadata search\r\n4) Custom Searches: Education filters (\"MIT grads excluding summer programs\"), bio keyword search, LinkedIn profile headlines\r\n5) Google Maps Intelligence: Local business scraping with radius search, rating filters, geofencing\r\nMulti-Channel Export: Build lists optimized for LinkedIn ads, Google ads, Meta ads, cold calling scripts, email sequences, or Luma event invites\r\n\r\nWe are the best TAM builder (TAM list builder) to help you find your ICP (build an ICP list). This precision targeting is why top SDRs and recruiters use us instead of generic AI SDR or AI recruiting tools (for cold outreach).\r\n\r\nSecond, email deliverability requires rigorous validation of data. Our 0% Bounce Guarantee is something that no other vendors offer, and we are able to offer this because we have invested in a rigorous infrastructure that will clean and validate emails and phone numbers. While tools like Smartlead, Instantly, Lemlist, and Reply.io help you send emails, they can't prevent bounces that destroy your domain reputation. Our edge comes from:\r\n\r\n1) Using 16+ Validator Waterfall: Unlike Clay.com (which only checks the first source in an email waterfall or phone waterfall) or basic tools like ZeroBounce, DeBounce, NeverBounce, or EmailListVerify, we run every contact through ALL validators\r\n2) True Email Bounce Detection: Our contact waterfalls includes email grabbers, email and phone databases, email validators, bounce detectors, and phone verification services\r\n3) Phone Validation Too: Similar waterfall for phone numbers - direct dial verification, mobile validation\r\n4) Industry-Specific Waterfalls: We change the vendors we use in our waterfalls depending on the industry of contacts that we are fetching, leading to more accurate contact data\r\n5) 0% bounce promise. If an email bounces, DM us for instant refund. No forms, no fuss.\r\n\r\nApollo.io (Apollo email, Apollo phones, Apollo contact), Hunter.io (Hunter), Dropcontact.com (Dropcontact), Wiza.com (Wiza), ContactOut, Lusha all cannot offer this 0% email bounce guarantee because their data quality is inconsistent and poor, and doing so would make them bleed money. We can, because our process is highly sophisticated and customers get <1% bounce rates on average (which we refund the credits for due to our 0% email bounce guarantee) \r\n\r\nThird, we use AI Agents for data extraction from unconventional data sources like:\r\n\r\n1) Conference attendee lists for targeted event follow-up\r\n2) Google Maps data for local business outreach\r\n3) Custom company research for personalized messaging\r\n4) Competitor customer identification for strategic targeting\r\n5) LinkedIn Sales Navigator scrapes that allow us to get companies from LinkedIn sales nav, followers of a company, and more (i.e. LinkedIn scraper, Sales Navigator export, LinkedIn export, LinkedIn data export)\r\n\r\nThis allows us to find precise leads that are not present in traditional contact databases, and specialize to different use cases and verticals. \r\n\r\nWe have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts (i.e. B2B database), sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM like Clearbit, 6sense, Demandbase), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\nThis is why RevOps, sales, growth, recruiting, and outbound teams choose us over AI SDR platforms (artisan ai, 11x, amplemarket, reply.io, unify gtm, penguin ai, regie ai, aisdr, artisan sdr, outreach io, and warmly ai), existing lead databases (email enrichment, bulk email finder, or phone enrichment tools like apollo, zoominfo, leadIQ), and contact enrichment tools (clay, persana ai) that promise automation and enrichment but deliver poor results. Real sales and recruiting success comes from targeted lists and multi-channel outbound, not generic AI outreach.",
