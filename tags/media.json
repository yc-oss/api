By making course creation as simple as uploading a video, we’re building Shopify for online education, empowering content creators and educators to transform their knowledge into engaging, interactive learning experiences.\r\n\r\nWe automatically generate high-quality courses—in under an hour—that people actually complete. On our platform, learners engage with short-answer and multiple-choice questions, as well as quizzes, receiving instant feedback and support from an AI voice tutor if they need more help.",
