    "long_description": "Vastrm Fashion™ (pronounced vas' trum) Vastrm was started to solve a basic problem: Shirts that don’t fit well!\r\n\r\nMass produced shirts were meant to accommodate a wide variety of body types with one standard size, and different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits! By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.\r\n\r\nTang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",
