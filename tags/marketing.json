One of the biggest challenges we see is staffing — many retailers struggle to maintain consistent, reliable, and properly trained team members to handle back-office tasks, marketing, ecommerce, POS management, and basic tech know-how.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we offer affordable, ecommerce expertise as a service. Retailers no longer have to worry about high turnover, constant retraining, or trying to learn everything themselves. Instead, they can stay focused on what they love: curating great products and delivering an amazing in-store experience — while we handle the rest. And since it’s a simple expense, it’s easy to plan for and write off, too.",

As attention spans shrink to six seconds, brands can't afford lifeless popups, forms, or landing pages. We replace them with gamified conversion layers—quizzes, swipe games, stackers—that perform like performance marketing.\r\n\r\nAt Unity, our founding team helped personalize gameplay and ads for over 2 billion users. Now, we're bringing that behavioral insight to brand engagement, building a no-code platform where anyone can launch PlayAbly experiences in minutes. Think: instead of a \"Spin to Win,\" a match-3 game that sells your product, segments your audience, and gets 4× the opt-ins.\r\n\r\nWhy now? Retargeting costs are up. Email/SMS open rates are down. And today’s customers are conditioned by the dopamine loops of TikTok and mobile games. Generic funnels can’t compete—but interactive ones can.\r\n\r\nPlayAbly is already driving results:\r\n\r\nClasskick (B2B): 5× ROI, 3× higher email open rates\r\n\r\nSkout Snacks (DTC): 7× ROI, 20% higher AOV, 4× opt-in rates\r\n\r\n89% of previously lost sessions re-engaged through PlayAbly games\r\n\r\nWe monetize on a usage + performance model, enabling fast adoption and deep long-term value. We're building a new category: AI-powered gamification that converts attention into intent, on any surface where customers meet brands.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.playably.ai",
