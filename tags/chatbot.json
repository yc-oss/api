We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",
