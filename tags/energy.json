Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.\r\n\r\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\r\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

We generate revenue by charging when electricity is cheap and discharging when electricity is expensive.\r\n\r\nWe rent battery storage for a fixed fee per month, and we earn 2x that fee in monthly revenue by dispatching the battery optimally.\r\n\r\nToday, power companies use human traders to manually track grid conditions and update the battery’s dispatch schedule. However batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g. hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to full speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more. Our AI better tracks 100s of live inputs, and it makes decisions faster than a human operator (with lower overhead!), improving revenue 2x.",

En route on this endeavor we’re commercializing High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cable technology for power distribution while advancing the physics basis of our HTS tokamak to decarbonize global shipping. \r\n\r\nBreakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

Fires bankrupt utilities and make them uninsurable.
