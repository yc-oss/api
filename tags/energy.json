Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.\r\n\r\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\r\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

    "long_description": "Maritime Fusion is building HTS (high-temperature superconducting) fusion reactors for defense and commercial shipping applications. Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

    "long_description": "Nuclear Software is the first continuous integration platform built for engineering simulations, designed for complex industries like nuclear, aerospace, automotive, and advanced manufacturing. It connects CAD models directly to simulation tools—neutronics, CFD, structural analysis, thermal simulations, and more—without manual data preparation. By automating geometry conversions and meshing, Nuclear Software eliminates bottlenecks and streamlines workflows, allowing engineers to focus on building better products.\r\n\r\nEvery design change automatically triggers simulations through a unified pipeline, ensuring real-time validation, version control, and traceability. Teams can customize workflows for individual components or run full system simulations, all within the same platform. Nuclear Software securely stores both designs and simulation results in a centralized repository, maintaining a complete version history linked to each design change. This single source of truth makes it easy to track progress, troubleshoot issues, and maintain accountability, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Software’s robust access control system protects proprietary and regulated simulation codes, ensuring compliance and data security. By automating simulation workflows and connecting design iterations to real-time validation, Nuclear Software accelerates development cycles and empowers engineers to innovate faster and with greater precision.",
