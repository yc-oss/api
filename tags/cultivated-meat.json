According to the UN, global meat production is projected to double by 2050.\r\n\r\nWith plant-based meat, cultivated meat, and fermentation, we can mitigate the environmental impact of our food system, decrease the risk of zoonotic disease, and ultimately feed more people with fewer resources. \r\n\r\nBy making meat from plants and cultivating meat from cells, we can modernize meat production.
