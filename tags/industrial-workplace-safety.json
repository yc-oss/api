With this information we can help improve operations while reducing spills and theft. This technology could change the way the oil and gas industry, water municipalities, and anyone dealing with high volume fluid, operates. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware send raw ultrasonic data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.",

Weâ€™re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\nðŸ¤• The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\nâœ… Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AIâ€™s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customerâ€™s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",
