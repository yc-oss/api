Billing patients and collecting their payments is a complex process that requires specialized skills and a lot of effort. Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results.\r\n\r\nArgovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale. Through both voice and text conversations, our AI agents can engage in complex, multi-turn patient billing and collection conversation. This leads higher engagement with payers and optimal collection results.",
