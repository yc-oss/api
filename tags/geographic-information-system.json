Through pairing a marketplace with integrated data management and collaboration tools, Geosite enables customers to leverage spatial data for more rapid and accurate planning and operations. This platform is a dual use technology for both commercial and military customers.\r\n\r\n//\r\n\r\n**SPACE PEOPLE**\r\nGeosite is a cloud-based platform creating a comprehensive repository of geospatial data, such as satellite imagery, through the aggregation of public and commercially available data, providing market-wide ability to rapidly search, select, purchase, assemble, and manage data sets. This will not only create the most comprehensive and exhaustive marketplace for geospatial data and analytics, but also build the underlying data infrastructure for the geospatial industry. This marketplace, for both analytics and data, will enable customers from Oil and Gas companies to US Special Operations to access and consume data from many sources for greater operational efficiency and safety. \r\n\r\n//\r\n\r\n**O&G PEOPLE**\r\nGeosite is a data platform for Oil and Gas companies that allows customers to bring together their data for a clearer picture of the world. Over 80% of information has a spatial component to it, rarely is this being leveraged to add to the bottom line for Oil and Gas companies. With the proliferation of satellites and distributed sensors (IOT), we are at a juncture of immense opportunity for Oil and Gas exploration to reach an operational efficiency that was impossible only a few years ago. Geosite allows for cutting edge logistics planning and operational tracking to increase safety and productivity. ",

It turns natural language into powerful spatial analysis, styling, and workflows with no GIS expertise required.\r\n\r\nWorking with geospatial data today is slow, fragmented, and deeply technical. Simple tasks often require desktop based software and coding expertise. Most platforms rely on outdated desktop software, steep learning curves, and disconnected tools. Even simple tasks like uploading data, running a buffer, or visualizing zones can take hours and require specialists.\r\n\r\nMonarcha changes that.\r\nWe connect directly to your data, enrich it with public datasets, understand spatial context, and let you run 50+ spatial tools instantly on the map. Upload vector or raster files, run PostGIS SQL queries, generate heatmaps, clip zones, and more all with a simple prompt. We're giving everyone the power of advanced spatial analysis to help save time, money and unlock siloed geospatial data across entire organizations. \r\n\r\nWant to learn more?
