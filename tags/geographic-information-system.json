This will not only create the most comprehensive and exhaustive marketplace for geospatial data and analytics, but also build the underlying data infrastructure for the geospatial industry. This marketplace, for both analytics and data, will enable customers from Oil and Gas companies to US Special Operations to access and consume data from many sources for greater operational efficiency and safety. \r\n\r\n//\r\n\r\n**O&G PEOPLE**\r\nGeosite is a data platform for Oil and Gas companies that allows customers to bring together their data for a clearer picture of the world. Over 80% of information has a spatial component to it, rarely is this being leveraged to add to the bottom line for Oil and Gas companies. With the proliferation of satellites and distributed sensors (IOT), we are at a juncture of immense opportunity for Oil and Gas exploration to reach an operational efficiency that was impossible only a few years ago. Geosite allows for cutting edge logistics planning and operational tracking to increase safety and productivity. ",
