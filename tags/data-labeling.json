JumpWire automatically identifies sensitive properties inside large data sets and gives developers full control over which people and applications can access or update records containing sensitive info.\r\n\r\nExamples uses include restricting who can read customer PII to members of the customer service team, giving on-call engineers elevated access to production, or splitting user records between regions for GDPR purposes.\r\n\r\nJumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.\r\n\r\nJumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.\r\n\r\nJumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data.",

We’re not a generic annotation vendor—we’re your on-demand evaluation and safety data engine. In under a minute, you can spin up your own data-annotation workspace tailored to your workflow, so your team can move from “we think it works” to measurable, repeatable results. \r\n\r\nModern AI changes quickly. Models evolve, prompts shift, and new edge cases appear the moment you go live. Besimple is built for that reality. Our platform generates task-specific annotation experiences aligned to your data and goals, so you can capture reliable judgment on everything from factuality and safety to preference and policy compliance. The result is an always-current evaluation loop that keeps pace with your product, rather than a one-off test that goes stale. \r\n\r\nWe specialize in evaluation and expert-grade safety data—not commodity labeling. That means we recruit and train domain experts and SMEs to judge model outputs against high bars, and we design the interfaces and guidelines to make those judgments consistent, auditable, and useful for both offline evals and production monitoring. \r\n\r\nYour team shouldn’t be waiting on back-and-forth specs and custom tooling. With Besimple, you can paste or stream your data, click to generate a tailored interface, and start collecting ground truth right away. When the task changes, the UI adapts with it. \r\n\r\nWe combine pragmatic product design with a human-in-the-loop operating model. Besimple helps you create clear, actionable guidelines and then enforces them with workflow guardrails, reviewer consensus, and targeted spot-checks—so you can trust the numbers you ship. Because we’re built for iterative work, teams can quickly compare prompts, models, and policies; spot regressions; and push fixes backed by fresh, expert-reviewed data. \r\n\r\nGreat models don’t happen by accident—they’re the product of tight feedback loops, expert judgment, and tooling that bends to your data, not the other way around. If you’re ready to replace slow, one-size-fits-all processes with a purpose-built evaluation and safety engine, Besimple gives you the fastest path from raw data to reliable decisions—so you can iterate boldly and ship with confidence.",
