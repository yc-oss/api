JumpWire automatically identifies sensitive properties inside large data sets and gives developers full control over which people and applications can access or update records containing sensitive info.\r\n\r\nExamples uses include restricting who can read customer PII to members of the customer service team, giving on-call engineers elevated access to production, or splitting user records between regions for GDPR purposes.\r\n\r\nJumpWire’s approach to securing data in-place minimizes the risk of data leaks exposing sensitive information or mishandling by other applications and vendors. The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.\r\n\r\nJumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.\r\n\r\nJumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data.",

    "long_description": "Spin up your own data annotation platform in 60 seconds!\r\n\r\nHigh-quality, human-reviewed data is essential for improving AI models.  Yet, many teams still use outdated tools or spreadsheets that aren’t built for complex data from LLMs and AI agents. This slows down iteration, drives up costs, and makes model performance unpredictable in real-world use.\r\n\r\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly.  Simply paste or stream any type of raw data—text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs—and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow.  Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.\r\n\r\nKey differentiators\r\n1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.\r\n2. Tailored guidelines – Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\r\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation – AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.\r\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment – On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.\r\n5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.\r\n\r\nToday we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more.  For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\r\n\r\nBesimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\n\r\nIf you’re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data —or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail—let’s talk. We’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.",
