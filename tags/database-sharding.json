    "long_description": "PgDog is an application for sharding PostgreSQL. It understands SQL and can distribute queries automatically between databases. It's built for managed databases, like AWS RDS, and doesn't require any changes to application code or schema.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sharding, PgDog is a load balancer and pooler, so it can act as a replacement for PgBouncer, RDS Proxy, and other Postgres scaling products. It brings the simplicity and performance of HTTP load balancing to the database.\r\n\r\nBuilt from the experience of sharding Postgres at Instacart during peak growth in 2020, PgDog is the answer to the old question: does Postgres scale? It does now.",
