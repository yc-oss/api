We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

We first launched an opioid product to support government and public health officials in responding to the opioid epidemic, and in 2020 launched a Covid19 product to estimate the scope and trend of the outbreak in communities. We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.\r\n\r\nBattling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database. Eventually, Biobot data will be an early warning system for disease outbreaks, a map of nutrition disparities, and more.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.biobot.io",

This results in high costs, data compliance issues, and vendor lock-in.  As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.  GrowthBook is well positioned to be a leader in this growing market.",

    "long_description": "Helicone.ai is creating an advanced observability platform tailored for developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to simplify and enhance the operational side of deploying these models, making it easier for developers to monitor, manage, and optimize their AI applications at scale. Helicone provides a unified view of performance, cost, and user interaction metrics for various LLM providers, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and LangChain, empowering developers to make their LLM deployments more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n\r\n1. **Centralized Observability**: Our platform captures and visualizes detailed logs and metrics across all LLM deployments. With tools for prompt management, performance tracing, and debugging, Helicone provides real-time insights into the inner workings of your LLMs.\r\n\r\n2. **LLM Performance Optimization**: Helicone supports prompt experimentation, success rate tracking, and fine-tuning, allowing you to continuously improve response quality and efficiency. This level of insight makes it easier to deliver high-performing, cost-effective AI applications.\r\n\r\n3. **Flexible Data Management**: We understand that data privacy is critical. Helicone supports deployment options for dedicated instances, hybrid cloud integrations, or self-hosted environments, allowing clients to maintain control over their data and ensuring compliance with privacy standards.\r\n\r\n### Built for Developers and Data Scientists\r\n\r\nHelicone is designed to meet the needs of engineers and data scientists who require transparency and control over their LLMs. From chatbots to document processing systems, Helicone equips you with the insights needed to track costs, understand user interactions, and optimize outputs—all from one intuitive platform.\r\n\r\nBy combining observability with LLM-specific insights, Helicone is redefining AI monitoring, empowering developers to deploy and scale their AI models with confidence.",

In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://orbio.earth",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.
