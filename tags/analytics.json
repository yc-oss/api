We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

We first launched an opioid product to support government and public health officials in responding to the opioid epidemic, and in 2020 launched a Covid19 product to estimate the scope and trend of the outbreak in communities. We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.\r\n\r\nBattling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database. Eventually, Biobot data will be an early warning system for disease outbreaks, a map of nutrition disparities, and more.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our website at www.biobot.io",

Our mission is to make healthcare pricing and contracting more transparent, easier to understand, fairer, and ultimately more affordable for all. New price transparency regulations have made a wealth of healthcare pricing and reimbursement data publicly available for the first time, but it is still extremely hard to ingest, organize, and actually use this data to understand the cost of care. That’s where we come in. Serif Health is building healthcare price intelligence data products and APIs to power the future of more transparent healthcare.\r\n\r\nWe are an early-stage, venture-backed startup with a small, collaborative team of healthcare experts, engineers, and designers. We are excited to add new team members motivated by our mission, passionate about making a difference in healthcare, and looking forward to learning and growing from the challenges we will face along the way!",

This results in high costs, data compliance issues, and vendor lock-in.  As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.

As these excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance companies that invest into oil & gas can’t mitigate against incoming risks from new regulations, \r\n\r\nWe have built a technology that can for the first time use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation. In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://orbio.earth",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.
