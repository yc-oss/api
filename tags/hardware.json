Whether building a single-use device from scratch or scaling a line of smart products, with Mason it’s 20x faster and 10x less costly to build, deploy and scale. Digital transformation is a modern requirement but operating a hardware-dependent initiative is hard – thousands of hours and millions of dollars are at stake.\r\n\r\nThe Mason Smart Device Platform is the only fully managed infrastructure for developing and delivering dedicated devices. It offers flexible usage-based pricing for fleets of devices and manages the underlying complexity of all associated backend services, making software delivery on a smart product line—whether it’s a tablet, wearable or new form factor—as simple as delivering software in the cloud. This frees innovators to focus on what matters: application development, feature specification and UX. Granular access to add, remove or lock down capabilities makes it possible for highly customized products to be built as envisioned.\r\n\r\nMason offloads hardware investment risks and logistics, including inventory procurement, warehousing and supply chain management. With options like zero-touch provisioning, devices can work perfectly out of the box without end user intervention. Remote fleet management, troubleshooting and automated software updates by Mason ensure security and positive end user experiences.

Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000°F.\r\n\r\nOnce the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more.\r\n\r\nOur key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability.\r\n\r\nPlease see Airthium's website for more information.",

Neural Networks are the most powerful engines behind today's AI, but simulations require massive amounts of power and time to learn all of the synaptic connections. As opposed to a simulation, our neuromorphic hardware is a physical artificial neural network, composed of spiking neurons and physical synapses. We combine unique electroceramic materials, nanofabrication techniques, and biologically plausible models of learning to create the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a new type of AI chip. The MN3 can possess over ten million spiking neurons per square centimeter, and uses far less power than conventional GPUs and CPUs.",

In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

The need for power will only increase.

Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

The FAA records four to five runway incursions every day, and over 90% of air traffic control facilities are operating below target staffing levels. Despite $20 billion in modernization programs like NextGen and Safety Management Systems, airports still lack a unified data backbone that connects communication, movement, and intent across the airfield.\r\n\r\nStratus provides the missing layer of intelligence for airport and airside operations — unifying data, communication, and movement into one shared, real-time picture.\r\n\r\nFor airports, this means faster decisions, clearer accountability, and safer, more efficient operations.\r\nFor aviation as a whole, it’s the foundation for connected, data-driven infrastructure that can finally keep pace with modern airside complexity.",
