We are backed by some of the best investors in the world including Foundation Capital, Y Combinator (S14), First Round Capital, SV Angel, Eric Ries and others. \n\nZoomer connects high volume delivery restaurants with independent delivery drivers. Our platform has been built to handle an extraordinarily high volume of concurrent deliveries. Restaurants leveraging the Zoomer platform are able to provide a better & more consistent delivery experience for their customer, which ultimately leads to a stronger bottom line. Independent drivers on the Zoomer platform have the ability to create their own schedule & increase their own efficiency, resulting in more earnings.  And of course, customers receive their orders dramatically faster than the status quo.\n\nThis is your opportunity to get in on the ground-floor.

Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product.
