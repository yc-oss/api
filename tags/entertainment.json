Writers see 4–5× gains in throughput without losing their voice. Manuscripts that sat untouched for years finally reach the finish line. Authors are using Plotdrive to break decade-long blocks. Publishers are using it to rethink how story pipelines should operate when continuity, context, and editorial craft can finally scale.\r\n\r\nThe printing press made distribution industrial.

This has given a new group of people the power to tell stories and present themselves on their own terms online while also protecting their IRL identities.  Our goal is to build the largest platform tools for this new movement. We're now  the #1 US VTubing app on iOS. \r\n\r\nWe also recently announced our seed funding: we're backed by Amazon, Two Sigma Ventures, MakersFund, YCombinator, and other great investors.\r\n\r\nApp Store: https://hyper.online/download\r\nTechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/hyper-raises-3-6m-from-amazon-and-more-for-its-iphone-based-vtuber-friendly-avatar-platform/",
