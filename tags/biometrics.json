The science is complex, the data is sparse, and most existing solutions are either too generic or too narrow to deliver meaningful insights. Women are left navigating life-altering symptoms with little guidance and few tools built specifically for them. Play Health changes that. We combine personalized tracking, at-home hormone testing, and AI-driven analytics to deliver actionable, data-first insights, and build the most advanced longitudinal dataset in perimenopause to date. This unlocks improved health today and enables the discovery of new diagnostics, therapeutics, and standards of care for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nPlay Health is led by successful, second-time, YC founders Andrea Mazzocchi and Ian Miller, with an exit and a unicorn between them.",
