Users can get instant quotes through our website (and eventually through integrations build on top of our API). We build custom internal software to command and control the operations of the factory. \r\n\r\nRight now we are actively working on fully automating the production of laser cut parts including scheduling, material movement, laser configuration, etc. Orders will be able to come in, and our software will control the factory and output parts ready to ship. \r\n\r\n",

F4 ensures design engineers never release noncompliant drawings—and suppliers never misinterpret them. We help hardware teams eliminate costly scrap, rework, and miscommunication at the root.\r\n\r\nWith a compliant drawing, F4 generates end-to-end drawing interpretations for standard definitions, inspection plan, and tolerance analysis application.\r\n\r\nF4 automatically interprets all GD&T symbols, datums, and notes based on the correct standards - no more second-guessing or misreading intent. Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, including the critical stack-up paths,  applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

    "long_description": "dScribe AI uses autonomous drones and 3D vision to track bulk inventory. We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.\r\n\r\nBulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
