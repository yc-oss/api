Our manufacturing processes are purpose built for the high mix nature of prototype work which allows us to command better margins and turn times. \r\n\r\nOne of the major reasons U.S. Manufacturing has fallen behind is a lack of urgency. If I were to order a part in Shenzhen at 8 AM, it would be on my desk by lunch time. This compounds over time and we look to bring that same power law back to the Unites States starting in the Bay Area.\r\n\r\nOur first capability that we are starting with is high precision 5 axis milling. If you are in need of parts on a quick turn feel free to reach out to us at : founders@foundation-industries.com. We are doing a controlled release of the service to if you would like to give us a shot we will forward you a link and access key. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

F4 ensures design engineers never release noncompliant drawings—and suppliers never misinterpret them. We help hardware teams eliminate costly scrap, rework, and miscommunication at the root.\r\n\r\nWith a compliant drawing, F4 generates end-to-end drawing interpretations for standard definitions, inspection plan, and tolerance analysis application.\r\n\r\nF4 automatically interprets all GD&T symbols, datums, and notes based on the correct standards - no more second-guessing or misreading intent. Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",
