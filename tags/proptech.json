This labor is used for a building’s: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans. Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.\r\n\r\nBuilding technology, methods, and materials have advanced and the constraints limiting home manufacturing can now be removed. Regulations have changed to allow small and simple accessory dwelling units (a.k.a. ADUs or backyard homes), making it easier to mass-produce housing. Pippin started in the ADU market with its brand \"Rent the Backyard\" and will build duplexes, quadplexes, and eventually large apartment buildings.",

Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

    "long_description": "ArchiLabs is building an AI co-pilot for architecture. Instead of spending hours on tedious tasks, architects can 10x their design speed with simple AI prompts.\r\n\r\nBrian and William met at Carnegie Mellon as engineers and separately had their own frustrating new construction experiences. Brian ran a tech-enabled homebuilding factory and found the design iteration process to be a massive bottleneck, while William built ground up homes in Texas and had a similar frustration. However, at the time, there wasn't an easy solution to the many pain points in the design process.\r\n\r\nAs AI reasoning models improve, Brian and William realized that there was a massive opportunity to fix the long-tail of frustrations and build a new construction design experience by fine tuning existing models, becoming bigger than Autodesk, the $60B company in the space.",

That makes bidding slow, expensive, and inconsistent — and homeowners often end up comparing apples to oranges.\r\n\r\nScout Out automates this step. We use computer vision trained on building plans to generate standardized material and labor takeoffs once, in-house. We then share those takeoffs with vetted contractors, so everyone is bidding on the same scope.\r\n\r\nThe result: homeowners get more bids, faster turnaround, and clearer pricing — without asking each contractor to redo the same estimation work.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting in Los Angeles, helping homeowners rebuild after the Palisades and Eaton fires.",
