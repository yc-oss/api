    "long_description": "Tenyks (YC S21) is a Cambridge University spin-out building the World's Most Versatile Visual Intelligence Platform—think Snowflake for Vision or GPT for Video.\r\n\r\nProblem: Companies today collect oceans of visual data (from cameras, drones, and satellites), but struggle to extract actionable insights. Current solutions rely heavily on manual analysis by call centres in locations like the Philippines or AI platforms narrowly focused on security rather than deeper operational insights. This leaves critical improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth unrealised.\r\n\r\nSolution: Tenyks unlocks unprecedented insights by applying advanced multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of comprehensive video summarisation, retrieval, and visual question-answering. These VLMs are seamlessly combined with specialised analytics for emotion detection, activity recognition, object tracking, and even gait analysis. Our platform transforms ordinary visual footage into extraordinary operational intelligence.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus: Starting with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), we enable operations leaders to instantly understand customer flow, kitchen efficiency, staff productivity, and quality of service using their existing security camera footage—turning previously inaccessible data into direct operational improvements and clear financial ROI. For instance, insights from Tenyks can accelerate the speed of service significantly; even a 1-second improvement in service speed could generate $30,000 additional annual revenue per restaurant. For a multi-unit owner of 100 restaurants, that's an additional $3 million per year.\r\n\r\nTraction: We've recently secured our first Fortune 500 customer, joining other major enterprises, global system integrators, and high-growth startups trusting Tenyks for powerful, data-driven decision-making.\r\n\r\nWhy Tenyks: Our patented technology originates from the founders' PhD research at Cambridge University. Previously, we helped world-leading teams scale high-performing Vision AI in production. \r\n\r\nRecognition: Recognised as a Rising Star in Gen AI by Sifted, Best Product of the Year by Vision AI Alliance, and Company of the Year by Cambridge University (previously awarded to DeepMind).",

Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Healthcare Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.

Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\r\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify brands deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 80% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\r\n\r\nWhy? Small businesses are the heart of the American economy and a lot of banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes and unlocks affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US as opposed to the high interest rates from online lenders.",

    "long_description": "Clarion is building the most advanced AI communication layer for healthcare, enabling clinics overwhelmed by routine calls and messages to finally come up for air. Our multichannel AI agents automate complex workflows end-to-end, freeing staff to focus on patient care. \r\n\r\nThe reality of healthcare today: clinics miss 30-40% of inbound calls due to staffing shortages, while patients struggle to connect with providers. We've built AI agents that handle scheduling, billing, prescription refills, and more—serving tens of thousands of patients monthly.\r\n\r\nWe're growing rapidly, serving dozens of customers including virtual care companies, outpatient health systems, and a $5B publicly traded health insurance company. With demand surging and revenue quadrupling in recent months, we're scaling our team.\r\n\r\nWe are an in-person company based in New York. We've raised $5.3M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout), and founders of Ophelia, Medallion, Counsel, Elemy, and Sana. \r\n\r\nOur clinician-led founding team combines healthcare operations expertise with technical excellence. Dr. Ryan Gallagher, our CEO, is a Stanford/Harvard-trained physician from the founding teams of Two Chairs and Ophelia (YC W20). Jeffrey Lamothe, our CTO, worked on voice AI at Amazon Alexa and led AI/ML projects at Salesforce and Citi.\r\n\r\nJoin us as we transform healthcare communication. We're creating a future where patients receive faster resolutions, staff are happier, and providers have more time for what matters most: patient care.",

Internally, Ellipsis actually executes the code it generates, just like a human does.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we allow developers to generate working, tested code directly from GitHub/GitLab. ",

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting.

From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",

For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise.

It can complete tasks across internal tools and 300+ apps using MCP servers, such as Apollo, Slack, Gmail, Notion, etc. It can take over many self-contained tasks, giving your team longer legs to run faster. It runs entirely in the cloud. This means that you can have swarms of agents completing hundreds of tasks while you’re focusing on what really matters.\r\n\r\nYou can connect Zero to the applications you use or your custom MCP servers, and then just give it any task and watch it work for you. Zero is engineered to think deeply, execute complex tasks, and even maintain a personalized memory of your interactions.\r\n\r\nA few notable features:\r\n- Built-in autonomy levels, permissions, guardrails, and human approvals\r\n- Custom instructions to teach Zero how to do things your way\r\n- Automations e.g. run a task every day or whenever I receive an email\r\n- Connect to your custom MCPs\r\n- Connect to 300+ apps with one-click integrations\r\n- Natively integrates deep research and browser use",

This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\r\n--\r\n\r\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows.

Our system handles front-desk inquiries, in-room dining orders, and reservations. It answers every question instantly and in any language, 24/7.\r\n\r\nWe are solving a problem that older phone systems and IVRs can't: customers hate not being able to talk to someone immediately, but most travel businesses can’t dedicate additional staff to manage phone lines. Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling them to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.\r\n",

Our platform starts with intelligent bookkeeping: we connect all their financial accounts, use AI to automatically categorize income and expenses, and assess their potential tax deductibility, giving creators a clear picture of their business finances and tax preparedness. This core solution, already actively used for expense management and tax Q&A, is the first step. We will rapidly expand to automate quarterly tax filing and payments, then provide integrated tools for S-corp formation and management, payroll, and benefits: truly becoming the 'Rippling for content creators.' Our success means creators save more money, reduce administrative burdens, and can confidently focus on their craft and growth within the creator economy.",

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

    "long_description": "Spin up your own data annotation platform in 60 seconds!\r\n\r\nHigh-quality, human-reviewed data is essential for improving AI models.  Yet, many teams still use outdated tools or spreadsheets that aren’t built for complex data from LLMs and AI agents. This slows down iteration, drives up costs, and makes model performance unpredictable in real-world use.\r\n\r\nWith Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly.  Simply paste or stream any type of raw data—text, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs—and we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow.  Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.\r\n\r\nKey differentiators\r\n1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.\r\n2. Tailored guidelines – Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation\r\n3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation – AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.\r\n4. Enterprise-grade deployment – On-prem optional install, and robust user management for internal SMEs, external vendors, or Besimple’s vetted annotators.\r\n5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins—just drop in your data, set guidelines, and you’re good to go.\r\n\r\nToday we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more.  For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.\r\n\r\nBesimple is built by a team that has done this before. Yi Zhong and Bill Wang built the annotation platform for Meta’s Llama models, significantly improving quality of data and shortening model development cycle.\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\n\r\nIf you’re building an AI product and struggle with good eval or training data —or if you have models in prod with no idea why they fail—let’s talk. We’ll show you how to launch a custom annotation flow in a minute, bootstrap an AI Judge in an afternoon, and start shipping better models tomorrow.",
