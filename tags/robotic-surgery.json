This control over smooth muscle tissues allows the surgeon to identify hidden anatomic structures (ureters, sphincters and others), determine tissue health, and even assist in diagnosing disease states. The technology is delivered through the surgeon's existing instruments (which have remained unchanged in over 30 years) giving a completely new capability to the surgeon while maintaining seamless workflow integration.\r\n\r\nWith an $600M (and growing)  initial market, the technology is future-proof and is readily able to be integrated into the continued advancements in the surgical space.",
