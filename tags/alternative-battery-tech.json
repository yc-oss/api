Replacing a 1MW diesel generator with a 1MW Intelline MLG system can save up to $1,000,000/year in fuel costs alone.\r\n\r\nThere are 200,000 new industrial generators produced per year, and at $85k for the average generator size this is a $17B market opportunity.\r\n\r\nOur generator can efficiently run emerging fuel types that traditional diesel engines can't use (flare gas, syngas, ammonia, hydrogen), and can switch between fossil fuels and any other liquid/gaseous fuel while running.",
