    "long_description": "Notebook solves the Web3 identity problem by using Zero-Knowledge to provide both anonymous proof-of-humanity and credential aggregation. Notebook initially verifies users’ identifying information to ensure that each person has just a single Notebook. Neither Notebook, nor any other company knows the link between a user’s personal information and their Notebook. Once a user’s Notebook account is created they can begin proving their humanity and aggregating their credentials across wallets.\r\n\r\nNotebook can be used to increase the safety of DeFi, governance, and airdrops. With Notebook, creators and communities can run Sybil-resistant airdrops, DAOs can verify the humanity and aggregate the credentials of participants, and lending protocols can build credit scoring systems to offer lower-collateralized loans.
