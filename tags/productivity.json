Hum is focused on real-time conversation and presence.\n\nIt makes it easy to see who else is currently viewing a thread. You can “read later” any threads you can’t get to right now, or pin important conversations to the top of the app. The company made a lot of bold claims about how it will transition you away from email as you use it more, but didn’t provide many specifics. Hum will have a steep uphill battle against incumbents like Yammer and Asana, and email, which has been harder to disrupt than most people realize.",

Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.\r\n",

In order for companies to win the war for talent, they need to provide a best-in-class candidate experience to recruit top talent, and our product aims at doing just that!\r\n\r\nOur founders Lydia Han (CEO) and Chris Triolo (CTO) both founded ModernLoop in December of 2020 after they saw the challenges recruiting teams had when it came to coordinating hundreds of interviews across various teams, all while making sure both hiring managers and candidates had the best experience possible. After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\r\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.

So Proxis built AI agents that handle the tedious, time-consuming work—everything from autonomous sales closers to customer service agents.\r\n\r\nThe mission is bold: to build the world’s most capable team of AI agents for every enterprise. Proxis imagines a future where a single founder can run a billion-dollar company—backed by a custom-built army of agents. Proxis is rethinking how agents are built, trained, and deployed from the ground up.",

Users stay on calls for multiple hours everyday where they depend on Focus Buddy to:\r\n• Avoid procrastination and get started: Address hidden anxieties, embrace imperfection, chunk tasks, kickstart with mini-goals, and use regular check-ins to maintain momentum.\r\n• Recover from distractions and stay focused: Focus Buddy detects when they are working on less important tasks or scrolling on social media, help them overcome the underlying concerns feeding the distraction, and help them get back to the important task\r\n• Manage stress and Prevent Burnout: Focus Buddy detects stress buildup, integrates mindfulness habits to the workflow, helps take short rejuvenating breaks, and stay composed.\r\n\r\nOur Initial ICP is people with ADHD who are highly motivated but also highly blocked by internal and environmental factors. In the future, we believe each worker should have their own personal coach that enforces proven productivity techniques in real time to help them extract more focused hours every day with the same effort. \r\n",

Founded by the creator of Zenter (YC 07, acquired by Google and became Google Slides), OrgOrg is designed to be a natural extension of Google Workspace Apps to help run organizations collaborate better leading to higher productivity.\r\n\r\nToday the suite includes apps like:\r\n  \r\n• Go links: Go links allows anyone in the org to easily name any link so team members can jump directly to the information that matters most: go/sales, go/production, go/anything-you-want.\r\n• Profiles with Personality: OrgOrg profiles are as insightful as they are delightful. They not only show you the expected org chart data, but also highlight accomplishments, how you like to work, and who you are as a person.\r\n• Goal tracking: Track, share, and collaborate on \"big rock\" goals on the cadence that makes sense for your team from daily to annually.\r\n• Branded New Tab: Keep the team focused the next major milestone, broadcast announcements, and keep important links top of mind every time a new browser tab is opened.\r\n• All Hands Q&A: Crowdsource questions, anonymously if desired, for large team meetings to make sure everyone's voice is heard, and the most top of mind questions are answered and recorded.\r\n• Smart Groups: Create rules based groups of people and use them to make sure the right people are in the right conversations and have the right access. For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\r\n• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way. Easily page the on-call from slack, API, or OrgOrg directly.\r\n• And more...\r\n\r\nAll the tools you need so you can spend more time focusing on your core business, and less time focusing on the complexity that comes from running an organization.",

Friday is building the assistant that learns how to predict the action that you will take on your emails, and does it for you.\r\n\r\nToday's email products try to help you go through your emails a little faster, but if you have to get through 1000 emails, those products doesn't do much for you. \r\n\r\nThe reality is, most of the emails you get don't require you to personally look at them. Friday completely eliminates the need to check those emails, and handles them all at once for you, immediately. \r\n\r\nFriday is here to file away spam, sift through newsletters for important tidbits, text you important notifications, and reply to mundane emails, so that no matter how many thousands of emails are in your inbox, you'll just be left with the few emails that actually require your personal touch.\r\n\r\nGetting this right is difficult, so everyone else settles with trying to help you go through your email twice as fast. If you want to go 100x as fast, you shouldn't spend even a second on useless emails. \r\n\r\nFriday gets this right, bringing the elite experience of having a professional assistant to the entire world.",

Teachers spend over 10 hours a week or 25% of all their work grading - Frizzle does it in minutes. Frizzle is the most valuable piece of software for teachers ever, as it eliminates the most time-consuming part of their workflow so they can focus on teaching.\r\n\r\nFrizzle shifts education from waterfall to agile learning. Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",

It error-checks workbooks end-to-end, builds models from scratch, and handles grunt work like extracting and linking data from IMs to template models - all within Excel so teams can review and iterate as usual.\r\n\r\nAgents struggle with tabular data - getting reliable, multi-step execution over thousands of interlinked formulas, sheets, and ranges is hard. Making Crunched good enough for people who live in Excel means knowing the pain points deeply.\r\n\r\nMichael and Philip has 10,000+ hours in Excel across consulting and finance. Markus and Lars bring deep expertise in scaling AI and enterprise solutions.\r\n\r\nWe've had easy access to first customers and are already live with firms across six European countries - we now plan to expand into the US. With >1bn total Excel users, we focus on the top 2%, highest-value Excel users globally. \r\n\r\nWe're solving one pain point at a time to create a product that doesn't just look good in a demo but actually works in production.\r\n\r\nExcel is here to stay, but the way experts model is fundamentally changing - with Crunched.",
