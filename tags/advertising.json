Most people don’t realize how much craft that takes — so most AI ads end up looking like slop.\r\n\r\nAbsurd replaces that process with autonomous AI agents, guided by a team of creative directors, to create production-quality videos in 72 hours. These agents collaborate with your team on Slack to plan, script, and generate every scene on an interactive canvas.
