    "long_description": "Hyper is an early stage startup with a mission to build the largest avatar platform in the world. We're starting by targeting consumer use-cases, and our first one is VTubing: an emerging type of content where creators use computer-vision and motion capture to pilot 3D avatars as content creation tools.\r\n\r\nAvatar content (also known as VTubing) has broken into the multi-billion-view-per-month category on places like Twitch and YouTube. This has given a new group of people the power to tell stories and present themselves on their own terms online while also protecting their IRL identities.  Our goal is to build the largest platform tools for this new movement. We're now  the #1 US VTubing app on iOS. \r\n\r\nWe also recently announced our seed funding: we're backed by Amazon, Two Sigma Ventures, MakersFund, YCombinator, and other great investors.\r\n\r\nApp Store: https://hyper.online/download\r\nTechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/hyper-raises-3-6m-from-amazon-and-more-for-its-iphone-based-vtuber-friendly-avatar-platform/",

Our team combines deep expertise in technology (AI Phds) and the fashion industry (Community builder). Our Virtual Dressing room is live with top retailers (such as Neiman Marcus) and has ~1M ARR.

The one who remembers everything, plans effortlessly, and keeps the crew together.\r\n\r\nHere's what that looks like:\r\n\r\n- Book restaurants together, with Yelp built in, directly in the chat. No more \"where should we go?\" spirals. Reserve instantly.\r\n- Create images with your friends: drop your crew into funny hats, wild scenes, anything you can dream up. Multiplayer image gen, first of its kind.\r\n- Social calendar: upcoming hangs, all in one place. Everyone on the same page.\r\n- Group Wrapped: who's the chattiest? Top inside jokes? Now you'll know.\r\n- Reminders & Memory: Alfi remembers your spots, your preferences, and nudges you to actually hang out.\r\n\r\nWe're in the middle of a quiet shift. Gen Z is leaving broadcast social media. They're retreating to group chats, smaller, more intentional and personal spaces where they're honestly themselves.\r\n\r\nBut group chats are also where plans go to die. Someone has to be \"the planner\" or nothing happens.\r\n\r\nWe believe the group chat is the real social network. Where the funniest moments and real conversations happen in real time. With Alfi, we hope to bring you together more expressively, a lot more often.\r\n\r\nThis technology will bring humanity closer than it's ever been before. Not replace connection, deepen it. That's the future we're building toward.\r\n",
