We're starting by targeting consumer use-cases, and our first one is VTubing: an emerging type of content where creators use computer-vision and motion capture to pilot 3D avatars as content creation tools.\r\n\r\nAvatar content (also known as VTubing) has broken into the multi-billion-view-per-month category on places like Twitch and YouTube. This has given a new group of people the power to tell stories and present themselves on their own terms online while also protecting their IRL identities.  Our goal is to build the largest platform tools for this new movement. We're now  the #1 US VTubing app on iOS. \r\n\r\nWe also recently announced our seed funding: we're backed by Amazon, Two Sigma Ventures, MakersFund, YCombinator, and other great investors.\r\n\r\nApp Store: https://hyper.online/download\r\nTechCrunch: https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/hyper-raises-3-6m-from-amazon-and-more-for-its-iphone-based-vtuber-friendly-avatar-platform/",
