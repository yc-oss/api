Line consolidates disparate sources of funds and simplifies finding and applying for incentives and financing.\r\n\r\nLine is designed to be user-friendly, available in multiple languages, and accessible on both web and mobile devices.

However batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g. hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to full speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more. Our AI better tracks 100s of live inputs, and it makes decisions faster than a human operator (with lower overhead!), improving revenue 2x.",
