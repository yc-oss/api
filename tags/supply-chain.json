By connecting everyone in the global economy we can unlock commerce, creativity, and human progress.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we’re building the platform for global logistics—empowering buyers, sellers and their logistics partners with the technology and services they need to grow and innovate. \r\nToday, we work with more than 40,000 customers and their suppliers across industries like manufacturing, retail, electronics, consumer goods, tech, apparel, and beauty. Companies of all sizes—from emerging brands to Fortune 500s—used Flexport technology to move nearly $19B of merchandise across 112 countries in 2021.\r\n\r\nInterested in joining our team?

This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.\r\n\r\nAttain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out at founders@joinattain.com!",

That lets us buy closer to actual demand, turn inventory faster, and materially reduce spoilage. For retailers, GETASAP replaces procurement teams and fragmented supplier management—we handle sourcing, inventory decisions, and fulfillment end to end as a single, reliable partner.
