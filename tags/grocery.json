We also give our retailer partners incremental trips that, in the past, they would have lost to competitors.  Aisle50 content, because much of it is in the form of offers that are paid for through Web or Mobile, compel the consumer to head to the store sooner rather than later.  \n\nEverybody wins: We drive trips to stores, new customers to CPGs and big discounts to consumers.",

To get the freshest produce, you need quick producer-to-end-customer delivery, not just quick warehouse-to-customer delivery. Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product. Membo's CEO, Vahur Hansen, was an early engineer at TransferWise, and co-founder, Paula Kink, built her own healthtech startup. Launched in Dec 2020, we've grown 30% MoM for the past 8 months and have delivered over 4000 orders in Tallinn, Estonia.",
