Planning your trip should be a joy, not a chore! We help people to travel responsibly, by booking direct instead of using traditional booking sites. Travellers get the best price and they help local businesses avoid unnecessary fees. \r\n\r\nTravel experts, content creators and the friends you always ask for recommendations can use The Guide to showcase their favourite places to stay and things to do. When you book one of their recommendations, you’ll get a discount from the business and they receive bonus credit to say thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Tab platform gives independent tourism businesses the tools to improve their online presence, be discovered, take direct bookings — and also to take payments. Our payment platform is uniquely designed for tourism businesses, handling over 100 currencies natively, and every payment type securely and easily.\r\n\r\nAs travel returns after a difficult period, it’s time for a fresh approach. That’s why we’re building a social commerce platform for tourism — helping to spread the benefits of tourism far and wide, and helping travellers make the most of their precious time abroad. \r\n\r\nWe're headquartered in London, and backed by Y Combinator (the investors behind Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe).",

Independent hotels lack the infrastructure to sell directly online, forcing them to pay OTAs 20-40% commissions on 40-60% of their bookings. Hotel websites don't convert (<0.5% vs. 5-10% in modern ecommerce), booking engines redirect users, payments are fragmented, and inventory is trapped in legacy PMS systems.\r\n\r\nMore critically: AI agents cannot book hotels directly today. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, none can complete a hotel transaction end-to-end because inventory isn't exposed in a machine-readable format.\r\n\r\nGuruHotel has built the complete solution: a full-stack ecommerce platform (website + native booking engine + checkout + payments + AI-ready APIs) that integrates directly with hotel PMS systems, enabling both humans and AI agents to book directly.\r\n",

Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.
