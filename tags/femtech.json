Our app combines evidence-backed therapy with coaching & specialist support for a subscription fee.\r\n\r\nPCOS is the most common cause of infertility in women, and can lead to diabetes, depression and cancer. Patients spend up to 10 years and thousands of rupees searching for the right treatment, yet 90% are dissatisfied with existing options. With our program, 85% patients report feeling \"in control\" of their PCOS after just 1 month and are 4-times more likely to complete treatment.\r\n\r\nThe founders, Shobhita (COO) and Shashwata (CEO) got an inside view into this massive need when the former was diagnosed with PCOS. Shashwata studied data science at Yale University, holds an MBA from Wharton, and helped grow Fortune 100 and growth-stage consumer health / product companies at McKinsey. Shobhita studied Biology & Psychology at Tufts University and has worked with leading healthcare companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline, Accenture Life Sciences & UnitedHealth.",

By embedding AI agents into care navigation, triage, and decision support, we reduce costs, accelerate outcomes, and personalize treatment at scale.\r\n\r\nOur hybrid care model blends targeted psychotherapy, psychiatric medication management, genetic testing, coaching, and holistic wellness—delivered by a curated workforce of women’s mental health specialists. Through continuous feedback loops, AI segmentation, and predictive insights, LunaJoy is built to scale.\r\n\r\nWe’re expanding our in-network footprint to make this care accessible across commercial and Medicaid populations—closing equity gaps for women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those most at risk.\r\n\r\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health conditions, and 3x more likely to endure trauma. Yet the system is still built for the “average” patient—ignoring the biological, emotional, and social complexity of women’s lives. LunaJoy is rearchitecting that system with AI at its core—because when we invest in women’s mental health, entire communities thrive.",
