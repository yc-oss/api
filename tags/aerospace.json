By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.\r\n \r\nREGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale flying demonstration vehicle. By this summer, REGENT will fly humans on the 15,000 lb (7000kg) first full-scale prototype seaglider, which will be the largest electric-flying machine in history.\r\n\r\nBy late 2026, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.  A 100 passenger version, already with firm orders, will follow several years later.\r\n\r\nIn just four years, REGENT has accumulated >$10B in pre-orders (including firm deposits) from airlines and ferry companies around the world.  Currently a team of 100, REGENT is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised over $100M to date from the likes of Founders Fund, Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Lockheed Martin, and is on contract with the US Marine Corps.",

The FAA records four to five runway incursions every day, and over 90% of air traffic control facilities are operating below target staffing levels. Despite $20 billion in modernization programs like NextGen and Safety Management Systems, airports still lack a unified data backbone that connects communication, movement, and intent across the airfield.\r\n\r\nStratus provides the missing layer of intelligence for airport and airside operations — unifying data, communication, and movement into one shared, real-time picture.\r\n\r\nFor airports, this means faster decisions, clearer accountability, and safer, more efficient operations.\r\nFor aviation as a whole, it’s the foundation for connected, data-driven infrastructure that can finally keep pace with modern airside complexity.",

    "long_description": "As autonomy moves into complex safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation), failures become more costly and companies must devote significant in-house effort to validate their system before real-world deployment. Valgo accelerates autonomous systems development and certification by providing tooling to perform algorithmic safety validation at scale. We are building a platform to efficiently find rare and realistic failure events in simulation at a fraction of the compute cost required by existing approaches. Our tools are agnostic to models/simulators (i.e., black box) and can be applied across industries such as autonomous vehicles, aviation, robotics, space, defense, energy, and finance.\r\n\r\nValgo was founded by Stanford PhDs who wrote the textbook and taught the course at Stanford on algorithmic safety validation. We also have significant industry experience working on an FAA-certified collision avoidance system at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, validating autonomous aircraft at Xwing, and collaborating with industry sponsors across transportation, aviation, and energy.",
