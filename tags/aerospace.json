By flying low on a cushion of air, seagliders unlock the ability to fly twice as far as an electric aircraft, while being regulated by maritime authorities enabling market entry for a fraction of the cost.\r\n \r\nREGENT has de-risked seaglider technology with a ¼-scale flying demonstration vehicle. By this summer, REGENT will fly humans on the 15,000 lb (7000kg) first full-scale prototype seaglider, which will be the largest electric-flying machine in history.\r\n\r\nBy late 2026, REGENT’s customers - airlines and ferry companies – will begin commercial seaglider service on the 12-seat initial product.  A 100 passenger version, already with firm orders, will follow several years later.\r\n\r\nIn just four years, REGENT has accumulated >$10B in pre-orders (including firm deposits) from airlines and ferry companies around the world.  Currently a team of 100, REGENT is led by MIT-trained, ex-Boeing engineers Billy Thalheimer and Mike Klinker.  REGENT has raised over $100M to date from the likes of Founders Fund, Japan Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Lockheed Martin, and is on contract with the US Marine Corps.",

This horizontal takeoff increases launch reliability and enables customers to directly access any orbit.  Our air-breathing propulsion system is up to 6 times more fuel efficient than any rocket, and uses oxygen from the air which creates thousands of pounds of additional payload capacity. \r\n\r\nWe have millions in current government/commercial contracts and LOI’s. \r\n\r\nWe have assembled a team of industry experts, government senior executives, and a NASA astronaut. \r\n\r\nThe hypersonic space plane will work by taking off from any runway with a jet propulsion system.  Next, it will climb to over 100,000’ and Mach 5.  At this point, it will launch a 2nd stage rocket directly into the desired Low Earth Orbit. \r\n\r\nVelontra is “boldly going where no one has gone before.”",

And, like an airship, it is extremely energy-efficient, enabling it to fly for up to 10 hours at slow speed (22mph) for optimal data collection which represents a range of 220miles. \r\n\r\nToday, energy infrastructure operators struggle with conducting inspections that are simultaneously: massive and precise. HyLight offers a solution to precisely detect issues on the infrastructure at an industrial scale, and all of this without emitting GHGs.\r\n\r\nWe are 3 co-founders experienced in hardware and energy companies with Masters in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Business from the best Engineering and Business School in France.\r\n\r\nWe have developed 5 different flying aircrafts and signed 5 pilots programs with major energy infrastructure operators.

    "long_description": "Maive automates aerospace compliance paperwork required on the manufacturing shop floor. We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.\r\n\r\nUsers have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\r\n\r\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.\r\n\r\nManufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. \r\n\r\nCompliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there’s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there’s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce. We’re on a mission to solve this by building the first AI native software for the shop floor. Our vision is to intelligently connect people, robots, and data to 10x today’s manufacturing capacity.",

It connects CAD models directly to simulation tools—neutronics, CFD, structural analysis, thermal simulations, and more—without manual data preparation. By automating geometry conversions and meshing, Nuclear Software eliminates bottlenecks and streamlines workflows, allowing engineers to focus on building better products.\r\n\r\nEvery design change automatically triggers simulations through a unified pipeline, ensuring real-time validation, version control, and traceability. Teams can customize workflows for individual components or run full system simulations, all within the same platform. Nuclear Software securely stores both designs and simulation results in a centralized repository, maintaining a complete version history linked to each design change. This single source of truth makes it easy to track progress, troubleshoot issues, and maintain accountability, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Software’s robust access control system protects proprietary and regulated simulation codes, ensuring compliance and data security. By automating simulation workflows and connecting design iterations to real-time validation, Nuclear Software accelerates development cycles and empowers engineers to innovate faster and with greater precision.",
