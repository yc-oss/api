We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.\r\n",

We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors.",

We are accelerating the global take-up of GLP-1 medications by increasing their accessibility to help solve obesity worldwide.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\r\n\r\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >40x since Aug 2023. We’re serving >50k customers with high NPS. We’re >$100M/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023.\r\n\r\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started. This is still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about working at Aios Medical here: https://fella.notion.site/working-at-aios-medical",

    "long_description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\r\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\r\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\r\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\r\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\r\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\r\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\r\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

Currently, we are focused on helping radiology AI teams prepare high-quality datasets to train their algorithms.\r\n\r\nRadiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI\r\n\r\nWe're a team based out of Bangalore India, and USA. We're backed by leading institutional investors like Y Combinator and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India). ",

Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.
