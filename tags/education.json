In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\r\n\r\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",

Founded in 2012, Clever was started by educators and technology professionals who knew that schools, teachers, and students could all benefit from the amazing learning software that was available, but key challenges stood in the way of accessing the technology. Today, half of K-12 schools in the U.S. use Clever to give students and teachers single sign-on access for any resource or file they need, and to automate software account setup and updates for district administrators. Clever gives teachers time to teach, helps districts be better informed, and makes using applications in the classroom effortless.\r\n\r\nWe are a team of more than 100 people passionate about education. If you feel the same way, you should see our openings at https://clever.com/about/jobs.",

    "long_description": "At Extern, we’re solving the experience gap.  Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship.  Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time.  Since 2020, we’ve created and powered Externships for over 50,000 students on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups.  \r\n\r\nAfter spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and they’re time-consuming for employers to run.\r\n\r\nExternships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern.  Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students.\r\n\r\nBy making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy.  We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education – no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status.  Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship.\r\n\r\nExtern was born out of a pivot from Paragon One (W17) which initially focused on providing students with a career center-as-a-service platform, connecting them with industry professionals to receive career coaching and guidance.  Backed by Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, Launch Fund, University Ventures, and Learn Capital.",

We began with the 150 most common science questions that children ask teachers. We call this collection Mystery Science. Last year, more than 4 million children used Mystery Science in 50% of U.S. elementary schools. In an industry that is plagued by long sales cycles and high barriers to entry, we’ve sold thousands of schools without a single sales person. We’re backed by a great group of investors including Y Combinator, Learn Capital, and Reach Capital.\r\n\r\nWe’re now moving on to all the other questions children have that they’ll never learn in school. In the last 18 months we received over 500,000 questions from children eager for better explanations of the world.  Now we’re creating video explanations for every question. You can think of this like a visual Wikipedia for kids.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create a generation of better thinkers. We think this is the most important problem to solve in the world today.",

(It wasn't until The Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the 1970's that Women and \"Minorities\" could even get fair access to credit)!\r\n\r\n\r\nAltro has created a mobile that allows anyone to have access to credit, using their subscriptions as a means to start building their credit score. Altro lends to members a $75 Line of Credit to pay for their subscriptions, such as Netflix, Hulu, HelloFresh, etc. This card is built to solely work on the subscriptions that the member is already paying for, allowing them to securely use their $75 credit to build their credit using things they are already paying for.\r\n\r\nDoing this empowers folx who were denied credit a way to start building their score and financial power. Altro will service millions of people in not only building their credit, but also gaining access to the tools (such as personal loans, emergency funds, car/house loans and more) that they could not access prior.",

Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",
