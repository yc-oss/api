Shipping an app requires stitching together multiple tools and coordinating across multiple roles. Reflex replaces that complexity with a single, unified platform to build, deploy, and manage production applications end-to-end.\r\n\r\nWe empower teams to own the entire lifecycle of their apps — from idea to production — without needing specialized infrastructure, DevOps, or platform teams. We do this by providing solid, reusable abstractions at both the framework and infrastructure layers. Because we own the underlying open-source framework and the platform it runs on, we can manage the full lifecycle of the application seamlessly.\r\n\r\nWith Reflex, teams securely connect to company data, use AI to build standardized applications on top of our open-source framework, and deploy with a single click to share across their organization.\r\n\r\nWe’re replacing the fragmented enterprise stack — and the organizational bottlenecks that come with it.\r\n\r\nFounded by Alek Petuskey and Nikhil Rao, Reflex has powered over 1 million applications, earned 28,000+ GitHub stars, and is used by 30% of Fortune 500 companies for internal tools and data-driven applications.",

This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

Human software engineers will become software engineering managers with AI software engineering teams behind them. Manaflow is building these interfaces to enable engineers to become 10x more productive with AI.\r\n\r\ncmux is an open-source app, and you can also bring your own API keys or OpenAI and Claude Max subscriptions.

We enable backend devs, designers and product managers to build pretty and functional web apps in a simple and visually guided manner - no matter the used tech stack.\r\n\r\nstagewise lives right inside your browser, makes changes in your local codebase and is compatible with all kinds of frameworks and setups - allowing it to be retrofitted into any existing project. Our agent enables you to show and tell what you want to change - all while using your app on localhost and without having to switch to external tools. Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe're two founders from Germany who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With Glenn's background in building dev tools for enterpries (Rheinmetall, Miele), as well as Julians experience in building web apps used by thousands (saasmetrix, strukto.io), we have the unique blend of experience and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to replace frontend devs completely, by gradually enabling both the backend devs, but also less technical designers and product managers to create well-designed applications. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built.",

We understand meaning in text, documents, and databases to detect sensitive information based on your policies, then apply recipient-specific controls without blocking workflows.\r\n\r\nCreate policies in natural language. Teams write rules that define what's sensitive and who should access it, and Velum enforces them consistently across all systems. When authorization changes, we can reveal tokenized data just-in-time for approved recipients, maintaining both security and utility.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly into your existing infrastructure. For AI workflows, we intercept prompts, responses, and retrievals to prevent sensitive information from leaking into or out of models. For enterprise systems like Salesforce, SAP, or Workday, we extend policy enforcement to exports, reports, and syncs.\r\n\r\nVelum is designed for scale and compliance. We provide encryption and structure-preserving tokenization for high-throughput pipelines, with multi-cloud deployment options and configurable data residency per tenant to meet your compliance requirements.",

Being open source and on-prem, we can get deployed in enterprises within minutes before other tools even get approval.\r\n\r\nWe met a decade ago at McGill University and have been building together full time for over 2 years.
