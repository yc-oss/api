    "long_description": "Casca is building AGI for banking. We are replacing 30+ year-old legacy technology with AI-native systems of record that automate 90% of the manual work humans used to have to do. Our first product is an AI-native Loan Origination System - with a built-in AI Agent, called Sarah. Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall businesses are the heart of the American economy. Many banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes. We unlock affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US who would otherwise be subject to the high interest rates from predatory online lenders.\r\n\r\nWe are a world-class team of banking & AI experts from Stanford, MIT & Y Combinator. We like to win and we know that the only thing between us and the title is our own ability to improve every day.",
