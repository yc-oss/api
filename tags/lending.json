    "long_description": "Could a fintech company be built that helps people today, and prepares them for tomorrow? One that offers consumers high quality, mobile-first credit and savings products and protects them from tricks and traps? That’s LendUp. LendUp's mission is to provide anyone with a better path to financial health. \r\n\r\nWe believe there are two types of financial products: chutes and ladders. Ladders help people up, chutes push people down. One of our core values is that every product we offer at LendUp is a ladder, measured by the long-term financial well-being of our customers. LendUp credit cards, loans, and savings resources reflect our commitment to getting our customers to a better financial state.\r\n\r\nWe are a data-driven company and build all of our technology in-house. With a firm belief that you're more than your credit score, we're extending credit as aggressively as possible and helping solve for the income volatility and financial instability that affects more than 140 million Americans. \r\n\r\nWe are backed by more than $325 million in debt and equity financing from investors such as GV, PayPal, Y Combinator, QED Investors, Susa Ventures, Data Collective, Thomvest Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Kapor Capital, Bronze Investments, radicle impact, Victory Park Capital, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Gmail founder Paul Buchheit, Troy Carter, and many others.\r\n\r\nOne of our values is \"different backgrounds, same mission.\"​ We come from venerable Silicon Valley technology companies, major banks, nonprofits and law firms. We're former consumer advocates, regulators and academics. Together, we're bringing our mission to life. Join us!",

Just 4 weeks after going live with our first customer, we purchased $1.3M in loans across 6 customers. The founding team brings 30+ years of startup experience: Vladimir previously worked as an operator at Facebook, Eventbrite, and Niantic; Asa Schachar was an engineer at Microsoft and managed teams of engineers at Optimizely; Molly Hogan led new and international product initiatives at Amazon for over 7 years.

    "long_description": "Hi - Mark and Gab here!\r\n\r\nWe met while working at Alt, a marketplace for collectibles, where we built a $200 million specialty finance business line. At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance—all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had—an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",
