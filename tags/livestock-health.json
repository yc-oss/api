    "long_description": "Nexa is developing the solution for cattle monitoring, leveraging implantable microchips that collect more comprehensive biometrics than anything else on the market. Our accompanying AI-driven animal health engine empowers farmers with early disease detection, reproductive insights, GPS tracking, and more. \r\n\r\nWe're saving farmers time and money while collecting the world's largest cattle health dataset. We believe that cattle farming should be a science, not an art - this will secure the world's food supply and increase economic output that billions of people depend on.",

Instead of a full day mustering with helicopters, motorbikes, and horses, farmers use GrazeMate.\r\n\r\nWe work with the world's largest cattle ranches, giving them complete visibility into their operations. While our drones herd cattle autonomously, they simultaneously estimate animal weights, measure grass biomass, monitoring water levels, and detect sick animals. We're building physical AI that gives farmers superhuman capabilities - managing thousands of livestock across massive distances from their phone.",
