    "long_description": "We’re building the next generation of warehouse robotics.\r\n\r\nIn the US today, retailers spend approximately $10B per year paying human laborers to pick up and move cardboard boxes in warehouses. Existing solutions for automating this are expensive and difficult to install, which is why manual operation is still so prevalent.\r\n\r\nOur solution is different. We make swarms of small mobile robots that install into existing warehouses to provide a low-cost and robust automation solution for case picking and mixed-SKU palletization. Our novel technology allows these robots to be installed and operate at significantly lower cost than existing solutions while being both flexible and robust.",

By combining real-time IoT sensor data with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, we create digital twins that simulate building performance in real time and autonomously optimize operations.\r\n\r\nOur platform optimizes airflow patterns and ventilation strategies to eliminate dead zones, improve air distribution, and reduce the load on mechanical systems. On the energy side, we minimize HVAC power consumption, reduce cooling costs, and lower overall operational expenses while maintaining optimal thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Beyond immediate operational efficiency, we optimize equipment scheduling and maintenance cycles by predicting system behavior under different conditions, allowing facilities managers to proactively address issues before they become problems.\r\n\r\nOur physics first approach ensures that we're not just optimizing against historical patterns, but optimizing based on a deep understanding of how air, heat, and energy actually move through your building, enabling us to find solutions that traditional rule-based or purely data-driven systems would miss.",
