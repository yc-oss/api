We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.
