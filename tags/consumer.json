One founder put on 45 lbs muscle, and another put on 25 lbs of muscle while losing 50 lbs of fat. Our alpha testers lost an average of 12.6 pounds in 3 months.\r\n\r\nOur core technology distills messy academic literature into simulations. Before turning to our own fitness journeys, we successfully deployed sophisticated enterprise models of plant-soil-atmosphere, consumer behavior and battery electrochemistry. With BODYSIM we built a science-based simulation of macronutrient balance and muscle hypertrophy. It includes cell turnover, oxidation for energy, lipolysis of fat stores, synthesis of new muscle, glycogen resynthesis, GI latency, and even ketones. Get jacked at BODYSIM.com\r\n",

    "long_description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\r\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\r\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\r\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\r\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\r\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\r\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\r\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. \r\n\r\nAdvantages to our P2P model\r\n\r\n- Entrepreneur-led\r\n    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters”\r\n- More variety in inventory\r\n    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet\r\n- Better margins\r\n    - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items\r\n    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition\r\n\r\nHere are some of our links!\r\n\r\n[dressd website](https://dressd.com/stylist-waitlist)\r\n\r\n[dressd instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shop.dressd/)\r\n\r\n[dressd tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdMPYFRY/)\r\n\r\nread about dressd in Yahoo!

As we will be able to attack the main pain points in the market: i) antiquated underwriting models and ii) payment conditions only adapted for the affluent.\r\n\r\nTo succeed, we have assembled an elite team with both innovative and experienced profiles. We are three cofounders, two ex-McKinsey and one ex-P&G, and we managed to attract two heavyweights of the Mexican insurance industry: the previous CUO of Zurich Mexico and the previous CFO and VP of Finance of ING and AXA Mexico.

It is perpetual and is completely on-chain, end-to-end. It is held as a token in wallets and can be sold/transferred to anyone at any time.\r\n\r\nAt institutional level, using EthosX’s options infrastructure two hedge funds can trade high-value on-chain options with each other directly without involving any banks or brokers with zero counterparty risk and zero settlement risk.\r\n\r\nWe are also providing derivatives infrastructure to other crypto companies who want to use these products as a part of a larger package to their customers.\r\n\r\nGlobal derivatives ecosystem is broken. Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nWe at EthosX intend to pick the best of both worlds and change the way retail and institutional financial derivatives are traded world over.",

We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.\r\n",
