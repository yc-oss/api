In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\r\n\r\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",

Independent developers, meanwhile, need a way to improve discoverability, extend their revenue stream and find a space in which content is rewarded based on quality, not marketing budget.\n\nThey are working to fix every one of those problems. They have built a discovery system that’s going to help you find games you truly love. Our community is a work in progress, but you can learn more on our blog.

As attention spans shrink to six seconds, brands can't afford lifeless popups, forms, or landing pages. We replace them with gamified conversion layers—quizzes, swipe games, stackers—that perform like performance marketing.\r\n\r\nAt Unity, our founding team helped personalize gameplay and ads for over 2 billion users. Now, we're bringing that behavioral insight to brand engagement, building a no-code platform where anyone can launch PlayAbly experiences in minutes. Think: instead of a \"Spin to Win,\" a match-3 game that sells your product, segments your audience, and gets 4× the opt-ins.\r\n\r\nWhy now? Retargeting costs are up. Email/SMS open rates are down. And today’s customers are conditioned by the dopamine loops of TikTok and mobile games. Generic funnels can’t compete—but interactive ones can.\r\n\r\nPlayAbly is already driving results:\r\n\r\nClasskick (B2B): 5× ROI, 3× higher email open rates\r\n\r\nSkout Snacks (DTC): 7× ROI, 20% higher AOV, 4× opt-in rates\r\n\r\n89% of previously lost sessions re-engaged through PlayAbly games\r\n\r\nWe monetize on a usage + performance model, enabling fast adoption and deep long-term value. We're building a new category: AI-powered gamification that converts attention into intent, on any surface where customers meet brands.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.playably.ai",

The first use case for our characters will likely be DnD-style roleplay, Minecraft RP, and Twitch streaming. \r\n\r\nCharacters will always live and exist in Simtowns with other AIs (and humans) where they will all lead varied internal lives replete with conflict, danger, opportunity, and love…just like humans in the real world!\r\n\r\nDuring YC, we used our engine to build TownWorld - a 3D interactive Twitch live stream of the Stanford generative agents paper (https://www.twitch.tv/townworld).

Sellers match their listings against Miniswap's catalogue giving buyers more information and structure as they shop.\r\n\r\nThe global market for tabletop games is estimated to be worth $20B in 2025 and Warhammer alone is projected to grow to $3B by 2030. By capturing the market in this untapped niche, Miniswap is strongly positioned to bringing greater transparency, simplicity, and connectivity into adjacent verticals.\r\n\r\nMiniswap's founding team merges deep domain knowledge with elite programming expertise and years of experience in business consulting and startups. Co-founders Zak and Will met while studying together at Cambridge, bonded over their love of Warhammer and early modern history. They have been best friends ever since. ",
