This \"intelligent insulation\" has no wires or sensors, and the fabric's shape-changing behavior comes from a natural materials response. \r\n\r\nSkyscrape’s fabrics offer expanded thermal comfort across a wider temperature range than conventional clothing. Creating textiles that could change shape with changing temperatures required years of laboratory work by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and weavers, designing and refining machines and processes to make yarns and fabrics that could adapt to the environment.\r\n\r\nSkyscrape's first market entry was with Ralph Lauren in the 2022 Team USA Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony.",

It is highly fragmented with a low NPS. The end user experience demands a significant amount of the customer's time, involving visits to a physical shop & avoidable back & forth. This is increasingly unviable for busy urban Indian women. We make it super easy by letting women place an order online, get fitted at the comfort of their homes, help them with styling their fabric & deliver the made-to-measure clothes directly to their doorstep.",
