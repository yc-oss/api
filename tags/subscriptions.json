Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process — involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers aren’t even aware that their payment failed.\r\n\r\n💰 Bottom line?\r\nEffective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10%\r\n\r\nFLYCODE SOLUTION 💡\r\nFlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn. We apply a unique model tailored to each Merchant and their customers to ensure optimal results.\r\n\r\n⚡️Automatically recover failed subscription payments and reduce passive churn\r\n\r\n⚡️Use ML & AI based payment optimization to find the best time to charge your customers\r\n\r\n⚡️ Improve customer experience by coordinating payment retries with customer emails/SMS\r\n\r\n🛠️ We support OOTB + Custom Integrations for Merchants and White-Label for Platforms\r\n",

Vijit also built Stripe’s customer portal which is used by customers of OpenAI and Perplexity to manage their subscriptions.\r\n\r\nAI Pricing models are evolving fast and existing billing providers can’t keep up. During our time at Stripe, we saw deals fall through with companies like Cursor and Figma for this reason. Frustratingly, these companies had to build their billing systems in-house. \r\n\r\nLark provides companies a flexible pricing engine that can support complex models like per seat credit pools and region based pricing. Finance teams can roll out pricing changes without any engineering effort. End users get an elegant billing experience. \r\n \r\nWe’re starting off by building an AI powered customer portal for subscription companies. End users can use it to manage their subscriptions and resolve billing issues. Our billing agents are live with 4 customers including Midjourney and CharacterAI.",
