James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\r\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies. Our vision is a world where all content, products, and policies are first simulated in an Artificial Society.

Rebuilding the same CDD survey from scratch. Programming those 100 question surveys.\r\n\r\nGeneric AI agents don’t work here. They don’t understand your content, your context, or your workflow.\r\n\r\nLemma builds AI teammates tailored to the way you actually work — built by people who’ve done the work. Our agents plug into your tools, learn your processes, and handle the grunt work behind the scenes — so you can focus on insights, strategy, and moving fast.",
