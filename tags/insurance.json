We are 100% digital, but not bots - we invest in tech that enables our experts to help Members.\r\n\r\nAs an Invitation Only Membership served by an MGA, **we can give Members Free Insurance** when they invite others, turning our \"Marketing Budget\" into savings for Members.  This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\r\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.\r\n\r\nOur granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:\r\n    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor\r\n    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)\r\n    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)\r\n    - added coverage for mold removal\r\n\r\nOur MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, \"renting\" capacity as we need it.\r\n\r\nAll this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors.
