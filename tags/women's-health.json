The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

We automatically analyze relevant demographic and clinical risk factors, flag high-risk patients, and provide evidence-based interventions, giving doctors months in advance to intervene and prevent complications from ever happening.\r\n\r\nOur global clinical studies have shown that we can catch 3x more complications than clinical judgment 10x sooner.

Despite this most only receive generic solutions and struggle to find effective symptom relief.\r\n\r\nWe're bringing evidence-based perimenopause care to women through partnerships with medical practices and employer and health benefits programs. Our platform integrates personalized symptom, medication, and lifestyle data to generate AI-powered insights and  clinical protocols, enabling providers to deliver specialized care.\r\n\r\nEvery clinical interaction enriches our longitudinal dataset allowing us to create better outcomes for patients, deeper insights for providers, and expand into women’s health broadly. This also enables us to partner with pharma and biotech companies developing therapeutics and diagnostics for women's health.",
