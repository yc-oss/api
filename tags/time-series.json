    "long_description": "PipelineDB is an open-source PostgreSQL extension that enables realtime reporting use cases by continuously aggregating large streams of time series data down into summary data. It shines the most at larger scales, where storing lots of raw time-series data and aggregating it over and over again becomes inefficient. The amount of value that PipelineDB adds is directly proportional to the amount of continuous aggregation that an analytics use case can benefit from. PipelineDB should be used for analytics use cases that only require summary data, like realtime reporting dashboards. PipelineDB is not a good fit for exploratory analytics on siloed datasets.\r\n",
