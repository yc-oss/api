Their mission is to have a positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the housing crisis through their sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildings’ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.\r\n\r\nThe company is certified under California's Factory Built Housing program to build units using 3D-printing, but they are also the first company to achieve certification under the UL 3401 standard for evaluating building structures and assemblies.",

In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. \r\n\r\nOur first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the \"green penalty\" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms.  \r\n\r\nFirst generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nBeyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside. \r\n\r\n",

We generate synthetic, photorealistic training data to help factories catch flaws before they ship. No manual labeling, no real defects required. Our models deploy to edge hardware and integrate easily into existing automation stacks.\r\n\r\nWe come from the self-driving world (Argo AI, Uber ATG, Stack AV), where we built reliable perception in high-noise, real-world environments. We're applying that experience to manufacturing: robust sensing, user-friendly interfaces, and fast iteration cycles.\r\n\r\nManufacturers hesitate to adopt new sensing due to data concerns, integration risk, and poor UX. We’ve handled petabytes of regulated autonomy data — and built systems that earn trust.\r\n\r\nLegacy vendors like Keyence and FLIR offer hardware-centric tools with bloated pricing and outdated software. We’re building the opposite: flexible, modern tools that engineers want to use.\r\n\r\nManufacturing is in the middle of a $700B automation wave across North America.

We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams. We already have two paying customers in the OEM and system integrator spaces. \r\n\r\nWe are venture backed and supported by a GBP 2.5MM grant by ARIA, the UK Government's invention agency. ",

Our technology is accelerating the engineering workflow with AI and scales design and optimization to identify the ideal designs for complex problems given their physical constraints with enhanced speed and performance. \r\n\r\nOur first model, UToP-v1, is a SOTA topology optimization model that understands physics, geometry, and manufacturability. It can generate the most efficient design given a problem’s physical requirements. It has <5% compliance error and is 1930x faster than current methods. We're reimagining mechanical engineering and computational design with precision spatial AI.",
