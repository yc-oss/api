This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

    "long_description": "Mezmo, formerly LogDNA, is an observability platform to manage and take action on your data. It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases.\r\n\r\nMezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\r\n\r\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\r\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\r\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\r\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\r\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\r\n\r\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.\r\n",

But it does eliminate several footguns like idle spend and accidental data egress, and it reduces the potential for users accidentally sharing credentials.\r\n\r\nFlowDeploy runs the pipelines in either our managed cloud or the customer's cloud – eliminating the need to transfer data externally.\r\n\r\nNon-computational biologists can use FlowDeploy, too: features like pipelines templates decrease the complexity to launch a new pipeline, which reduces user error and decreases the need for advanced cloud training for non-computational users.",

We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\r\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\r\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\r\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\r\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\r\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\r\nOur Products:\r\n\r\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\r\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

Companies like PostHog, Wistia, Appsmith, and Secoda use Depot to save tens of hours of build time every day.\r\n\r\nWe offer a remote container build service for building Intel & Arm Docker images, from your CI or local machine, up to 40x faster. Our container builds come with in-depth build insights, ephemeral registries, and instant cache sharing across your team.\r\n\r\nFinally, we also offer our own Depot GitHub Actions Runners that brings all the speed of Depot to your entire GitHub Actions workflow at half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners, and up to 10x faster builds. Simply change the runs-on label of your existing workflow to route jobs to Depot runners.\r\n\r\nKyle and Jacob worked together as staff engineers for 4.5 years at Thorn and Era Software, before founding Depot. Depot is their solution to the wildly inefficient container build tooling and non-performant CI systems they encountered throughout their careers. \r\n",

This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

Lucidic AI turns that institutional knowledge into consistent agent behavior by continuously testing, stress-simulating, and auto-optimizing agents against your real production scenarios.\r\nLucidic ingests your real logs, edge cases, and operational rules, then uses controlled simulations, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian optimization to automatically discover failure modes, propose targeted fixes, and verify improvements before anything reaches production. Instead of relying on manual prompt fiddling or guesswork, your agents get a continuous improvement loop: they’re tested, corrected, and optimized based on what your business actually requires—not what a generic model assumes.\r\nThe result is AI agents that reliably follow your domain logic, adapt to changes, and stay aligned across clients, configurations, and environments—without you needing to hand-engineer every prompt or behavior.",

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15). Having experienced the pain of slow builds firsthand across hundreds of production codebases, we're building the solution we've always wanted.",

    "long_description": "Cyberdesk is the first self learning computer use agent for developers to automate desktop workflows. \r\n\r\nFor example, one of our customers is building an AI agent for hospital patient intake, and they’re using us to automate an entire team of people manually clicking and typing into a desktop app to book appointments. \r\n\r\nWe launched mid July, and our agent is already operating in production environments, creating appointments in electronic health record apps and processing files in legacy ERPs.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built the first computer use agent that memorizes tasks and repeats them quickly while still adapting to unexpected changes on the screen. A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

Unsafe actions, whether it’s a rogue DROP TABLE or a payment above policy limits, are blocked before they touch production. Behind the scenes, Alter manages credentials, issuing ephemeral, scope-narrowed access for every interaction, then rotating or expiring it in seconds. The result: no long-lived secrets, no blind spots, and no surprises in audit.\r\n\r\nWith Alter, teams can move fast on AI agent initiatives while staying fully compliant with SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and internal security standards. A CISO-ready dashboard delivers real-time visibility, detailed audit logs, and compliance-ready controls, removing silos, eliminating excessive permissions, and providing complete oversight of every agent workflow.",

We did a massive amount of work on our previous platforms that was not specific to our product, and we’ve created Modelence to abstract that away:\r\n- Authentication\r\n- Database setup\r\n- Hosting / CDN\r\n- AI integration (LLM observability, prompts)\r\n- Real-time events\r\n- Cron jobs\r\n- Email service\r\n- Monitoring\r\n- Analytics\r\n- Admin dashboards\r\n\r\nAndrej Karpathy recently posted about this same exact problem:\r\nhttps://x.com/karpathy/status/1905051558783418370\r\n\r\nand explained it further in his YC AI Startup School talk:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ?feature=shared&t=1940",

They're all racing to be more autonomous, running for hours without human input.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work for real production code. When agents run autonomously, they make countless small decisions that pile up in your codebase. Engineers lose ownership - they don't know what was implemented, can't effectively debug or maintain it, and struggle to build on top of it. The code becomes a black box, and they're forced to throw it away.\r\n\r\nCompyle keeps engineers in the driver's seat.",

    "long_description": "Moss is building the real-time semantic search runtime for conversational and multimodal AI. Our system enables voice agents, copilots, and chat interfaces to retrieve, reason, and respond in sub-10 ms, delivering the responsiveness that makes AI interactions feel truly natural.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever built a conversational or voice AI product, you’ve felt the lag. That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding. Moss is already powering production pilots across voice AI and developer platforms, achieving sub-10 ms retrieval and 70–90% token savings compared to traditional pipelines.",
