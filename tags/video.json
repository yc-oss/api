This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. \r\n\r\nOur CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.\r\n\r\nOur video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",

We achieve this through pioneering research in multi-modal AI models for human perception and understanding, combined with state-of-the-art human avatar rendering and conversation models that we make accessible to developers worldwide. Our models and APIs power everything from text-to-video AI avatars to real-time conversational video experiences across industries like healthcare, recruiting, sales, education, and more. By enabling AI to see, hear, and communicate with human-like authenticity, we're creating the foundation for developers to create the next generation of AI employees, assistants, and companions.",

    "long_description": "Tenyks (YC S21) is a Cambridge University spin-out building the World's Most Versatile Visual Intelligence Platform—think Snowflake for Vision or GPT for Video.\r\n\r\nProblem: Companies today collect oceans of visual data (from cameras, drones, and satellites), but struggle to extract actionable insights. Current solutions rely heavily on manual analysis by call centres in locations like the Philippines or AI platforms narrowly focused on security rather than deeper operational insights. This leaves critical improvements in efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth unrealised.\r\n\r\nSolution: Tenyks unlocks unprecedented insights by applying advanced multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) capable of comprehensive video summarisation, retrieval, and visual question-answering. These VLMs are seamlessly combined with specialised analytics for emotion detection, activity recognition, object tracking, and even gait analysis. Our platform transforms ordinary visual footage into extraordinary operational intelligence.\r\n\r\nInitial Focus: Starting with Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), we enable operations leaders to instantly understand customer flow, kitchen efficiency, staff productivity, and quality of service using their existing security camera footage—turning previously inaccessible data into direct operational improvements and clear financial ROI. For instance, insights from Tenyks can accelerate the speed of service significantly; even a 1-second improvement in service speed could generate $30,000 additional annual revenue per restaurant. For a multi-unit owner of 100 restaurants, that's an additional $3 million per year.\r\n\r\nTraction: We've recently secured our first Fortune 500 customer, joining other major enterprises, global system integrators, and high-growth startups trusting Tenyks for powerful, data-driven decision-making.\r\n\r\nWhy Tenyks: Our patented technology originates from the founders' PhD research at Cambridge University. Previously, we helped world-leading teams scale high-performing Vision AI in production. \r\n\r\nRecognition: Recognised as a Rising Star in Gen AI by Sifted, Best Product of the Year by Vision AI Alliance, and Company of the Year by Cambridge University (previously awarded to DeepMind).",
