Unlike legacy MDM or “after-the-fact” compliance software, Swif.ai delivers enforcement—not just reports—plus device-level Shadow IT/AI governance to detect and block risky or unauthorized SaaS and LLM tools.\r\n\r\nEnterprises choose Swif.ai for true multi-OS coverage in a single pane of glass, one-click remediation, and fast time-to-value via silent installers and native integrations with Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and Google Workspace (conditional access by device posture). The result is fewer tools to manage, shorter audits, and stronger security with lower operational burden. Swif.ai is SOC 2 Type II. Our near-term roadmap adds Safe-AI controls for regulated industries, AI-agent monitoring, and integrated vulnerability detection with one-click fixes—expanding our lead as the enforcement layer for endpoint compliance and AI security.\r\n",

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

Agentic AI delivered on day one: Our platform couples cutting-edge AI infrastructure with built-in reliability, security, and observability so teams can launch production-grade agents in days, not months.\r\n2. White-glove engineering included: Dedicated engineering support to help end-to-end, from scoping to launch to continuous optimization - at no extra cost.\r\n3. Success over software: We measure our impact by real business outcomes, not seat counts.

All backed by Dialtone’s best-in-class AI infrastructure and agent orchestration platform.\r\n2. Humans in the loop - Employees can seamlessly collaborate with agents when human input or oversight is required.\r\n3. Triggers + Surfaces - Configure agents to run on integration events, time based schedules, or arbitrary webhooks - all in an easy-to-use UI. Or, use and talk with agents from your existing chat and email surfaces.\r\n4. Integrations Library - 100+ (and counting) first-party data, action, and event connectors for the software and tools you already depend on.\r\n5. Observability - View every step of any agentic flow with easily parseable real-time logs and traces for rapid debugging, optimization, and auditing.\r\n6. Custom Integrations + API - Extend agents with your proprietary systems and software using your existing OpenAPI specs and MCP servers. Need even more customization?

But as soon as you move into Founder-Led Sales, you hit a wall. When an enterprise customer asks for a ramp-up period, tiered usage, or a custom quarterly billing schedule, Stripe’s standard checkout breaks.\r\n\r\nYou end up with \"Billing Debt\" - a mess of manual invoices, spreadsheets to track renewals, and \"hacked\" subscriptions that will eventually require a painful migration.\r\n\r\nWe built Veles to be the sales-led billing layer for Stripe. It’s the flexible \"Deal Desk\" that lets you sell exactly how your customer wants to buy, without the manual overhead.\r\n\r\nThe Problems We Solve (So You Don't Have To):\r\n✅ Complex Pricing & Logic: Whether it’s usage-based, flat-fee hybrids, or \"draw-down\" credits, if you can dream up the pricing logic, Veles can bill it through your Stripe account.\r\n\r\n✅ Custom Deal Structures: Close deals with custom ramp-ups or non-standard terms without manually editing Stripe objects.\r\n\r\n✅ Deal Desk & Approvals: Set guardrails so your first sales hires can’t go rogue on pricing. Build a repeatable approval workflow for every contract.\r\n\r\n✅ Presentation Flexibility: Your quotes should look as professional as your product. Veles generates quotes as Web Portals, Slides, Docs, or PDFs—all while staying perfectly synced to your backend.\r\n\r\nThe YC Offer:\r\nI want to make sure no YC founder is held back by their billing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nCurrent Batch (W26): Veles is 100% Free for your entire founder-led sales phase. Focus on hitting PMF and closing your first 20-50 deals; we’ll handle the \"Deal-to-Cash\" automation.\r\n\r\nYC Alumni: 50% off the Growth Plan for one year. Scale your sales team and automate your revenue operations without the \"Enterprise CPQ\" price tag.\r\n\r\nStop forcing your custom enterprise deals into rigid billing templates. Sell what the customer wants, and let Veles keep your Stripe account clean.\r\n\r\nI’d love to hear from anyone currently fighting with Stripe’s \"manual invoice\" button. What’s the weirdest contract structure a customer has asked you for lately?",
