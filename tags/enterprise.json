Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

The COO's hair is on fire and we put it out.\r\n\r\nOur platform is built on agentic search, connecting across 40+ enterprise integrations - CRMs, email, knowledge bases.\r\n\r\nAgents often fail because their underlying context windows are mismatched, leading them to hallucinate. We built enterprise native agentic search to ensure agents have all the context they need to operate fully autonomously.\r\n\r\nHere's what Clarm's C-suite buyers use us for:\r\n\r\n- a blockchain company to provide an on-demand source of product truth in natural language, reducing alignment meetings by 90%\r\n- a financial services firm to supercharge their own product by integrating it with the target's enterprise knowledge\r\n- the top 5 X25 open source startups (by star count) to increase engagement with their Github repo and knowledge base, turning repo visitors into contributors and customers\r\n- North America's largest fertility clinic to tailor '000s of client support questions with extremely high sensitivity, driving up engagement and turning prospects into committed customers",
