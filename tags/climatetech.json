Through thoughtful reinvention of everyday interactions, we empower people everywhere to collectively make a greater impact with their most basic daily rituals. \r\n\r\nWe started with the shower. \r\n\r\nThe Nebia shower embodies the highest standards of experience, design, engineering and water and energy use. With water savings up to 70% compared to traditional showers, Nebia was designed to make a meaningful impact without compromising on experience.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our products is our unwavering dedication to developing groundbreaking sustainable solutions that stand the test of time. Every new iteration is made to solve a complex engineering challenge that has limited innovation for over a century. Our investment in R&D and product development is second only to our investment in the people who are making it possible.\r\n\r\nAfter several years working behind the scenes, we are extremely proud of what we have recently achieved:\r\n- $10m raised on Kickstarter\r\n- Products in 100,000 homes\r\n- 500+ million gallons of water saved (c. 2022)\r\n- 27 million kWh (27 GWh) of energy (approx. energy to heat 2,700 U.S. homes in one year)",
