We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.\r\n\r\nOur health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.\r\n\r\nAll of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward. We want to close the gender data gap. And we stand for every person who identifies with women, however they define it.",

This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why are we the leader?** \r\n\r\nThe company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:\r\n\r\n1. Nationwide insurance coverage (10M+ lives)\r\n2. Military contracts (Including the Navy SEALs and 15M+ veterans)\r\n3. Employer offerings (Working with the top fertility benefit providers)\r\n\r\n**Tell me about the team** \r\n\r\nWe're a team of about 30, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning. \r\n\r\nLearn more about our values here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/legacys-values-and-why-they-matter-db116539d3da\r\n\r\nLearn more about our workplace here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nRead about our mission to humanize the path to parenthood:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nLearn more about sperm and why it matters here:\r\ndocsend.com/view/zkgk7ws",

We are accelerating the global take-up of GLP-1 medications by increasing their accessibility to help solve obesity worldwide.\r\n\r\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\r\n\r\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\r\n\r\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\r\n\r\nWe’ve grown >1000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >40x since Aug 2023. We’re serving >50k customers with high NPS. We’re >$100M/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023.\r\n\r\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started. This is still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about working at Aios Medical here: https://fella.notion.site/working-at-aios-medical",

With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\r\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\r\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\r\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\n\r\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\r\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\r\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\r\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\r\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

The company was founded by Orestis Vardoulis  PhD  a biomedical & mechanical engineer and expert in digital health (EPFL/Stanford) and Urs Naber  MD  a critical care physician (Dartmouth/Stanford).

    "long_description": "At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone.\r\n\r\nAlmost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",

There are over 100 deadly chronic conditions as 1 out of 2 Americans is currently living with at least 1 chronic condition. The US healthcare system has over $1 trillion dollars in direct costs. Medical adherence rates for therapeutic programs and medicine are only 50% because patients feel lonely, isolated, and unsupported in their chronic illness journey.\r\n\r\nReviving Mind is an in-network telehealth provider that improves clinical outcomes and program adherence for the senior medicare and medicare-advantage population that is plagued with loneliness and chronic illness. This is done through a novel and proprietary clinical program and technology platform that integrates virtual, private, curated, and professionally led groups that scale up to 8-patients with individualized and goal oriented lifestyle medicine coaching that is automated but managed by a licensed provider.\r\n\r\nScaling rapidly across the United States.",

    "long_description": "Aidy is a mobile app that helps people live fuller lives with chronic health conditions, beginning with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis). Our app lets users easily log their symptoms, diet, and treatments, then uses clinical indices to track disease severity and trends over time. Aidy excels at identifying patterns between diet, treatment adherence, and symptoms, giving our users a much more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of their condition to supplement clinician care. \r\n\r\nPreviously in our careers, both Max and Peter worked in health in different capacities. At the Rockefeller Foundation and the United States Senate, Max worked in public health policy and COVID-19 response, while Peter worked as an ML researcher for a number of biotech companies. After a lengthy “pivot hell” we decided to finally listen to a friend with IBD who insisted that there weren’t any decent apps to help people live with the disease. Pretty quickly, we discovered how LLMs and regular structured questionnaire responses could provide a level of patient empowerment not possible before for chronic diseases. From there, Aidy was (re)born!",
