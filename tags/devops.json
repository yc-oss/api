At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

    "long_description": "Janet AI is the intelligent ticket management system.\r\n\r\nAs organizations scale, Jira turns into chaos. Related issues are filed under different teams. De-duping is tedious. Critical insights get lost in comment threads. Tickets are never seen by anyone with full context. As a result, teams spend hundreds of manual hours just figuring out what’s important—before they can even start fixing it.\r\n\r\nJanet AI automatically creates, tracks, and resolves work items through integrations with information channels like Slack, meetings, customer cases, GitHub, and more. Further, Janet AI watches every incoming ticket to build a knowledge graph and automatically surfaces related tickets, streamlines routing, flags prior fixes, and identifies what matters most—across all projects and teams.",
