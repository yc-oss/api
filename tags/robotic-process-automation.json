Our models deploy to edge hardware and integrate easily into existing automation stacks.\r\n\r\nWe come from the self-driving world (Argo AI, Uber ATG, Stack AV), where we built reliable perception in high-noise, real-world environments. We're applying that experience to manufacturing: robust sensing, user-friendly interfaces, and fast iteration cycles.\r\n\r\nManufacturers hesitate to adopt new sensing due to data concerns, integration risk, and poor UX. We’ve handled petabytes of regulated autonomy data — and built systems that earn trust.\r\n\r\nLegacy vendors like Keyence and FLIR offer hardware-centric tools with bloated pricing and outdated software.
