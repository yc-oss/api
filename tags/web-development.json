Making changes is as easy as selecting elements, giving a simple prompt like “make it green and put it in the top right corner”, and immediately seeing the result.\r\n\r\nWe are two German engineers who met while working at a B2B SaaS startup. With backgrounds in both enterprise engineering (Rheinmetall, dSPACE) and building web apps used by thousands, we have the unique blend of discipline and product sense needed to build this.\r\n\r\nAfter making our initial launch with the open-sourced toolbar that puts your favorite coding agent right inside your browser and going viral with it, we’re now launching a high-speed coding agent dedicated to frontend development - taking our product and the experience of our users to the next level.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to empower anyone to create well-designed applications, regardless of their technical skill. We start with developers who lack design experience, but our ultimate goal is to change how products are built. stagewise will enable non-technical stakeholders - product managers, designers, and marketers - to directly iterate on the UI themselves, creating a new, collaborative workflow and making us the essential tool for building on the web.",
