    "long_description": "Engineering tools should be as streamlined and smart as everything else in your life: as your phone, as your email, as all the apps that help you manage your day-to-day. Your work should be as efficient as possible so you can generate innovative ideas, design elegant technology, and manufacture at scale, all because you can focus on the right things. There should not be any distractions caused by poorly designed websites, unreliable data, or unwieldy spreadsheets of haphazard electronic component information. You should be able to compare components, find important technical information, and easily grasp the spectrum of parts that will be a match for your design.\r\n\r\nThis is what Octopart strives for.\r\n\r\nFinding electronic component information should not be holding engineers back from bringing ideas to life quickly and efficiently. We believe that pricing, availability, technical specifications, and reference designs should be transparent, fast to find, and easy to understand. That’s why we create powerful, intelligent tools that streamline the engineering workflow and enable fast decision making. Octopart provides accurate and complete data for millions of electronic components in a way that makes it easy to find and compare parts. Focus on the important stuff: building the technology of the future.",

It provides suggestions and recommendations for each question, making sure we have thought about everything early on. \r\n• Validations: Once the questions are answered, we consolidate them into a document and run parallel agents to once again find issues, contradictions, or areas of improvement. \r\n• BOM Generation: Our AI splits the scope into a block diagram and generates a Bill of Materials (BOM) for each by parsing diagrams and tables from datasheets, getting price and lead time data from top vendors, and internal vendor communications. \r\n• Versioning & Parallel Agents: You can branch designs and use parallel agents to simulate multiple architectures simultaneously, revealing quantitative tradeoffs in cost, price, and lead times \r\n\r\nWe met during our first week of college and became roommates at Berkeley, and are excited to make physical innovation easier!\r\n",
