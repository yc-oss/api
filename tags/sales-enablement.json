If you already have an internal email when a user signs up, you can forward it to StackLead and we'll reply with a complete research report. We also provide a Salesforce integration (stacklead.com/blog/qualifying-leads-in-salesforce-with-stacklead/) and webhooks API (stacklead.com/docs).\n\nGet started at stacklead.com or contact us at team@stacklead.com",
