With Termius, engineering and DevOps teams can share the list of servers that can be organized in groups and tagged for faster search. Termius also has built-in Terminal and Snippet Sharing. Terminal Sharing enables getting instant help from colleagues via providing a unique link instantly, and snippets are frequently-used shell commands that allow teammates to learn from each other easily.",
