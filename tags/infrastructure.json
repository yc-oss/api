We work really hard because we care deeply about what we do.\r\n\r\nSauna is Wordware’s AI workspace for professionals. Think ‘Cursor for Knowledge Work’ and you’re halfway there. With explicit permission, it connects to tools like Gmail, Calendar, Slack, and thousands more, to gather the right context to move your work forward. It learns who you are, drafts and refines your documents, presentations, and datasets, researches across the web and your org’s internal knowledge, summarizes long threads to cut through the noise, proposes next steps, even acts on your behalf when enabled. You can work with Sauna live, side-by-side, or schedule jobs to run automatically in the background, with clear permissions and easy off-switches.

Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.\r\n\r\nExisting solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.\r\n\r\nWith Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.\r\n\r\nEliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15). Having experienced the pain of slow builds firsthand across hundreds of production codebases, we're building the solution we've always wanted.",

    "long_description": "Voltair builds drones that charge on transmission power lines. For the first time, this allows for drones with infinite range. Removing battery swaps is the last step to deploy UAVs autonomously at scale. After building drones for the Air Force and DARPA, Ronan realized this was both practical and technically feasible.\r\n\r\nPower utilities are the perfect first customer. Extreme weather creates catastrophic electrification and wildfire liability, bankrupting utilities and making them uninsurable. Voltair's drone inspections identify critical maintenance concerns before they spark fires. Autonomous drones can deliver over 20x the inspection coverage for the same cost. Following extreme weather, Voltair's forward deployed drones can rapidly patrol neighborhoods for electrical hazards.\r\n\r\nSince June, we’ve validated our core charging tech on a power line, built 5x flying prototypes, and inspected ~2000 poles.\r\n\r\nWith 50 miles of range, we can service 90% of the U.S. land area. After power companies, we will service rail, road, telecom, real estate, and other inspection markets. At scale we are a new infrastructure layer for data on the physical world.",

The Cumulus Prediction system will learn usage patterns to optimize resources available to customer jobs.\r\n\r\nGetting started takes less than 20 lines of config. Fine-tuning becomes as simple as specifying your data and model architecture, while inference deployments automatically optimize for latency and cost. \r\n\r\nCumulus handles all GPU orchestration complexity, allowing teams to save on cost and significantly boost performance in real-time while focusing on what matters: building & serving better models. The result is 50-70% cost savings, faster cold starts, and never spending time managing infrastructure ever again.\r\n",
