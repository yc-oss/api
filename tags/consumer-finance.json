At Alt, we faced the complex challenges that come with servicing consumer loans. We spent countless hours and resources developing internal tools to manage loan payments, communicate with borrowers, and keep track of loan performance—all while ensuring a positive experience for our customers.\r\n\r\nHowever, after dealing with the headaches of manual data entry, fragmented systems, delayed payments, lack of personalized borrower engagement, and the stress of maintaining accurate records, we knew there had to be a better way to service consumer loans.\r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the servicer we wish we had—an AI-powered consumer loan servicer designed to streamline and enhance every aspect of the loan servicing process. \r\n\r\nOur mission is to transform loan servicing into a seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experience.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",

Your spreadsheet is always wrong. You make expensive mistakes because this isn't your full-time job.\r\n\r\nHire a financial advisor: They'll manage your money and charge 1-2% of assets annually. Run that math over multiple decades and you're handing over half your net worth to fees.\r\n\r\nNeither path can economically deliver the sophisticated, personalized strategies the ultra-wealthy use to compound wealth: strategic tax-loss harvesting across individual securities, systematic risk management, portfolio-backed borrowing to defer capital gains, access to alternatives, etc.\r\n\r\nThese aren't secret – they're just economically impossible to deliver at scale through traditional human advisors.\r\n\r\nRobos were supposed to fix this, but they were designed in a pre-AI world. In practice they just manage cookie-cutter portfolios. They don’t coordinate across your 401(k), taxable accounts, mortgage, equity, and cash flow, they don’t help with real decisions like job offers, windfalls, or concentrated stock, and they don’t deliver institutional strategies. That’s why, even after a decade plus, the biggest robos are still <$100B AUM while old-school advisors like Raymond James / Edward Jones sit on trillions.\r\n\r\nWe’re doing for financial advising what Robinhood did for brokerages. Think of it as a full-stack, AI-native wealth strategist that brings billionaire-style playbooks to ordinary investors.\r\n\r\nAutonomous is built around a frontier-scale reasoning engine—an AI that perceives global events as they unfold, understanding their deeper implications for markets and and most importantly, how these events will impact your investments.
