They cannot help you read and reply to your Slack messages and emails, manage your calendar, file expenses, send money on Venmo, compare Uber and Lyft prices, etc.\r\n\r\nBlue can do all of this and more.\r\n\r\nIt taps, swipes, and types like a human on both iPhone and Android, so it doesn't need any app-specific integrations. This is made possible through a voice-first computer-use model as well as a custom hardware. \r\n\r\nIt already works in the real world. Users are texting, shopping, and navigating their phones completely hands-free. People who are commuting, cooking, or multitasking are using Blue to reclaim meaningful time during their day.\r\n\r\nOur team brings rare and highly complementary experience. Omar led Google Assistant’s transition to LLMs and holds one of the earliest patents in LLM-based computer control. Peter brings decades of experience designing and building voice-first dialog systems, holds multiple design patents, and was most recently the design lead at Google DeepMind serving actions on the Gemini Live model. Farhan helped ship Apple’s Vision Pro and holds more than 50 patents in hardware and systems design. He's also led several products end-to-end from early prototyping to mass production and global fulfillment.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have built systems used by billions of people and are now building something even more fundamental: re-inventing the way we use and interact with technology.",
