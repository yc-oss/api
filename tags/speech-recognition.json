Additionally, in most languages typing is really hard/slow. As a result, text-interfaces (apps and websites) haven't worked in emerging markets and most work have remained offline. This is causing economies billions of dollars in lost worker efficiency.\r\n\r\nVoice AI can fix this, and onboard 100s of millions of new users on to digital services -- for the first time. \r\n\r\nBut current Voice Models suck... After the top 5 languages, the models are so bad you can't make any Voice product on top of them. We are fixing this by creating state of the art models for regional languages. \r\n\r\nWe are able to do this coz we created unique data gathering and labeling methods to solve for small languages. We already have SOTA models in multiple languages (like Balochi, Sindhi).\r\n\r\nWe are on a mission to uplift entire nations by giving everyone access to digital information and digital services. \r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nOur team has previously created Voice technology used by millions daily. We worked on Alexa and Siri; And have launched entire AWS services like AWS Bedrock Guardrails.\r\n \r\nWe do in-house research and development.

On iPhone, a tiny USB-C plug-in (“Bud”) provides precise input control so Blue can act on your behalf.
