You can “read later” any threads you can’t get to right now, or pin important conversations to the top of the app. The company made a lot of bold claims about how it will transition you away from email as you use it more, but didn’t provide many specifics. Hum will have a steep uphill battle against incumbents like Yammer and Asana, and email, which has been harder to disrupt than most people realize.",

    "long_description": "Guggy developed two innovative communication and creation products that reached global audiences. The Guggy API was a high-scale contextual messaging engine that analyzed text messages—including slang and short conversational fragments—to understand their meaning and automatically generate matching GIF responses. It combined a custom NLP engine, a relevance-matching system, and a real-time GIF regeneration pipeline, and was integrated into leading messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Viber, Kik, Telegram, Slack, and major Asian chat apps, serving millions of requests per day.\r\n\r\nGuggy also created Bits, a short-form video creation app designed for actors, comedians, and everyday creators to craft original comedic scenes with ease. Bits provided intuitive but powerful tools for scripting, timing, character changes, audio control, and scene composition, enabling fast, high-quality creative expression. The app attracted tens of thousands of creators and was featured in Fast Company for its innovative approach to mobile video creation.",
