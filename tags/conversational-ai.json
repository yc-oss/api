    "long_description": "## What is Yuma AI?\r\n\r\nYuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify brands deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 80% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

On our platform, simworld, users will be able place the characters in a Stardew Valley style simulated town, where the AI characters will live, work and play, leading rich internal lives.

    "long_description": "careCycle is an AI workforce for medicare agencies and FMOs - helping leading agencies achieve 5x higher conversions, 37% better retention, and saving thousands of agent hours.\r\n\r\nWe're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

We started Codyco after a friend told us how much money he was losing from missed calls. We built the first version just for him.\r\n\r\nNow we give hotel groups the reliable AI they need, so they never lose a booking on the phone again.",
