The data is collected by Care Weather’s unique flat-panel radar satellite, which is 1000X more cost effective because it’s vertically integrated, gets more solar power, and sails on top of the atmosphere for a closer view of the surface. Our team includes CEO Patrick Walton (NASA Earth science fellow) and CTO Alex Laraway (mach 4 rockets). In the last 4 months, we built and launched the smallest radar satellite ever. We have $35M worth of LOIs, including one from the Air Force and others from cargo shippers. Care Weather is backed by Boost VC, Kickstart Seed Fund, Y Combinator, and more.",

Our proprietary architecture uses deterministic one-step diffusion to transform complex radar signals into clear, photorealistic images. This enables persistent, 24/7 situational awareness for defense, commodities trading, and disaster response, guaranteeing visibility even when the sky is blocked.",
