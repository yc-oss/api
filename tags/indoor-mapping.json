They talk to each other and communicate with  with servers. A digital copy of the physical space is created in the cloud, allowing for inch-precise and real-time tracking of assets, people, and vehicles. When they move or interact with each other pre-programmed actions are triggered as defined in the apps \"installed\" in different rooms or places. Apps can be downloaded from the marketplace of create by developers using JavaScript and a robust API.\r\n\r\nThe system utilizes wireless technologies such as Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband to automate processes and track the movement of objects. SpaceTimeOS allows for the creation of smart workplace applications and the digital twinning of entire businesses and supply chains, as well as the blending of physical and digital data.",
