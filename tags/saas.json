This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program. Its customers include Google, Lyft, Kickstarter, AirBnb, Coursera, Bonobos, Spotify, Vimeo, Bustle, and many others.",

It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases.\r\n\r\nMezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\r\n\r\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\r\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\r\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\r\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\r\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\r\n\r\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.\r\n",

Whether building a single-use device from scratch or scaling a line of smart products, with Mason it’s 20x faster and 10x less costly to build, deploy and scale. Digital transformation is a modern requirement but operating a hardware-dependent initiative is hard – thousands of hours and millions of dollars are at stake.\r\n\r\nThe Mason Smart Device Platform is the only fully managed infrastructure for developing and delivering dedicated devices. It offers flexible usage-based pricing for fleets of devices and manages the underlying complexity of all associated backend services, making software delivery on a smart product line—whether it’s a tablet, wearable or new form factor—as simple as delivering software in the cloud. This frees innovators to focus on what matters: application development, feature specification and UX. Granular access to add, remove or lock down capabilities makes it possible for highly customized products to be built as envisioned.\r\n\r\nMason offloads hardware investment risks and logistics, including inventory procurement, warehousing and supply chain management. With options like zero-touch provisioning, devices can work perfectly out of the box without end user intervention. Remote fleet management, troubleshooting and automated software updates by Mason ensure security and positive end user experiences. Organizations of all sizes rely on Mason to bring innovations and hundreds of use cases to market without reinventing the wheel.

Maintaining Selenium/Cypress tests is also a big challenge. Preflight solves this problem by understanding how users understand any page and adapt to the changes and update the selectors if the test passes.\r\n\r\nIt's also super easy to set up end-to-end tests that depend on each other with Preflight's Workflow feature. You can orchestrate which test should run after another.\r\n\r\nCreating API tests has never been so easy. Preflight prepopulates API tests from UI tests' network calls. So, you can set up API tests in minutes. ",

Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that’s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you’re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn’t otherwise remember.\r\n",

The supply-chain in Malaysia and across Southeast Asia lacks meaningful real-time connectivity between suppliers and retailers. Hence we are determined to transform this industry by providing businesses the right tools to grow.\r\n\r\nOur modern, digital approach to the wholesale industry allows retailers to discover, purchase, and manage inventories for their store - all on a single marketplace platform. And our software tool for suppliers helps businesses to deal with all the pain points of growing customer database, from ordering to payments.\r\n\r\nWith our data-driven approach, we connects local, independent retailers with the right brands, distributors, and wholesalers to stock their store with the best products. This saves retailers and suppliers time and money, allowing them to focus on what's most important: building and running their business.\r\n\r\nborong is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",

As the internet has become more powerful and crowded, it has become harder for everyone to use. And the solutions we’ve come up with to date — like irritating chatbots and pestering popups — end up being ignored or even annoying users more than they help.\r\n\r\nWe sell tools to software builders and buyers to help them make their software better for users.\r\n\r\nWe call this as our User Assistance Platform, and it comes in 2 pieces:\r\n- AI Agent — an AI chat agent that can answer users questions, perform actions for them, and even co-browse with them to teach your interface.\r\n\r\n- Nudge Platform — AI-assisted nudges, hints, and messages to guide users in personalized ways that don’t annoy them. We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

Zoko solves this by seamlessly integrating WhatsApp commerce capabilities with your existing Shopify infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTHE UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY THAT'S COSTING YOU SALES\r\nConsider this: 175 million people message businesses on WhatsApp daily - that's more engagement than Amazon generates. With 100 million merchants already using WhatsApp for business globally, those not leveraging this channel are falling behind competitors who are capturing sales directly through conversations.\r\n\r\nPROVEN SUCCESS FORMULA\r\nZoko's founders didn't just theorize about WhatsApp commerce - they lived it. Starting with their own ecommerce business entirely on WhatsApp, they scaled to 200,000 engaged followers who eagerly purchased products through weekly WhatsApp updates. When other businesses began paying for access to their \"WhatsApp sales tools,\" they knew they'd discovered something revolutionary.\r\n\r\nTHE $50 BILLION MARKET OPPORTUNITY\r\nThe WhatsApp commerce market represents over $50 billion annually - a massive revenue stream that traditional ecommerce platforms can't access. For Shopify merchants, this means untapped customers, higher engagement rates, and sales happening through the world's most trusted messaging platform.\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE SALES, MARKETING & SUPPORT INTEGRATION\r\nZoko transforms WhatsApp into a comprehensive business channel, enabling Shopify merchants to:\r\n- Convert conversations directly into sales\r\n- Run targeted marketing campaigns through WhatsApp\r\n- Provide instant customer support where customers prefer to communicate\r\n- Build deeper customer relationships through personalized messaging\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF COMMERCE IS CONVERSATIONAL\r\nWhatsApp represents the internet for the next billion users entering the digital economy. Zoko positions itself as the \"Shopify for WhatsApp merchants,\" giving existing Shopify store owners the tools to dominate this emerging channel before competitors realize its potential.\r\n\r\nFor Shopify merchants serious about growth, Zoko isn't just another tool - it's the bridge to the next generation of ecommerce where conversations convert to sales.",

Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.\r\n\r\n👨‍🏫 Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. \r\n\r\nAfter we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nWe worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. \r\n\r\nWe then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. \r\n\r\n🚀 Present & Future\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. \r\n\r\nSo far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",

However, DTC brands can't afford to do this, and they don't have enough customer data to make the conventional recommendation approaches work. Suggestr uses innovative multi-modal AI technology that sees and understands products (needs 100x less data), allowing it to work with brands of all sizes (SME, mid-market, enterprise).

We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\r\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\r\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\r\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\r\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\r\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\r\nOur Products:\r\n\r\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\r\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.\r\n\r\nAttain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out at founders@joinattain.com!",

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

Companies rely on old compensation survey data, which are updated only once every year.\r\n\r\nThe salary expectations of candidates in the market change significantly on a quarterly basis (~7% statistically) in the startup ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis results in more than 50% of qualified/selected candidates not joining the company due to expectation mismatch.\r\n\r\nCompUp is an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool. We integrate with your existing HR/payroll systems, removing the need for manual data entry, and also getting updated in real-time.\r\n\r\nCompUp provides the most accurate real-time compensation benchmarking data which helps you make the right offer to the candidate.

    "all_locations": "San Francisco, CA, USA",
    "long_description": "Fiber AI helps GTM and recruiting teams build surgical TAM lists that AI SDRs/AI BDRs can't create. While AI sales automation tools fail at targeted prospecting, we provide advanced filters (headcount growth tracking, fundraising data, education filters, Google Maps scraping) to build niche audiences for multi-channel outbound (i.e. things like LinkedIn ads, Google ads, Meta ads, cold email, cold calling, invites to Luma events, and other outbound). Our 16+ provider waterfalls deliver high quality emails and phone numbers, and we offer a 0% email bounce guarantee, making this a risk-free offer for customers (something that Apollo.io, Clay.com, Hunter.io, People Data Labs, LeadMagic, Prospeo, FindyMail, Wiza, Icypeas, FullEnrich, Datagma, Dropcontact, and others can't and won't ever offer).\r\n\r\nThe problem with AI sales copilots and AI sales automation is that they can't build targeted lists. Success in modern sales requires niche, surgical targeting - then executing personalized outbound across multiple channels. That's where Fiber AI excels.\r\n\r\nOur platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, building precise lists that AI SDRs can't match (replaces broad AI BDR spraying, unfocused AI sales automation, and lead generation software). We are able to filter on things like:\r\n\r\n1) Headcount Growth Tracking: Find scaling companies with monthly, quarterly, yearly employee growth metrics\r\n2) Deep Filtering: Fundraising history, Ivy League alumni search, promotion patterns, office expansions\r\n3) Intent Signals: Open jobs data, hiring patterns, technographic filters, company metadata search\r\n4) Custom Searches: Education filters (\"MIT grads excluding summer programs\"), bio keyword search, LinkedIn profile headlines\r\n5) Google Maps Intelligence: Local business scraping with radius search, rating filters, geofencing\r\nMulti-Channel Export: Build lists optimized for LinkedIn ads, Google ads, Meta ads, cold calling scripts, email sequences, or Luma event invites\r\n\r\nWe are the best TAM builder (TAM list builder) to help you find your ICP (build an ICP list). This precision targeting is why top SDRs and recruiters use us instead of generic AI SDR or AI recruiting tools (for cold outreach).\r\n\r\nSecond, email deliverability requires rigorous validation of data. Our 0% Bounce Guarantee is something that no other vendors offer, and we are able to offer this because we have invested in a rigorous infrastructure that will clean and validate emails and phone numbers. While tools like Smartlead, Instantly, Lemlist, and Reply.io help you send emails, they can't prevent bounces that destroy your domain reputation. Our edge comes from:\r\n\r\n1) Using 16+ Validator Waterfall: Unlike Clay.com (which only checks the first source in an email waterfall or phone waterfall) or basic tools like ZeroBounce, DeBounce, NeverBounce, or EmailListVerify, we run every contact through ALL validators\r\n2) True Email Bounce Detection: Our contact waterfalls includes email grabbers, email and phone databases, email validators, bounce detectors, and phone verification services\r\n3) Phone Validation Too: Similar waterfall for phone numbers - direct dial verification, mobile validation\r\n4) Industry-Specific Waterfalls: We change the vendors we use in our waterfalls depending on the industry of contacts that we are fetching, leading to more accurate contact data\r\n5) 0% bounce promise. If an email bounces, DM us for instant refund. No forms, no fuss.\r\n\r\nApollo.io (Apollo email, Apollo phones, Apollo contact), Hunter.io (Hunter), Dropcontact.com (Dropcontact), Wiza.com (Wiza), ContactOut, Lusha all cannot offer this 0% email bounce guarantee because their data quality is inconsistent and poor, and doing so would make them bleed money. We can, because our process is highly sophisticated and customers get <1% bounce rates on average (which we refund the credits for due to our 0% email bounce guarantee) \r\n\r\nThird, we use AI Agents for data extraction from unconventional data sources like:\r\n\r\n1) Conference attendee lists for targeted event follow-up\r\n2) Google Maps data for local business outreach\r\n3) Custom company research for personalized messaging\r\n4) Competitor customer identification for strategic targeting\r\n5) LinkedIn Sales Navigator scrapes that allow us to get companies from LinkedIn sales nav, followers of a company, and more (i.e. LinkedIn scraper, Sales Navigator export, LinkedIn export, LinkedIn data export)\r\n\r\nThis allows us to find precise leads that are not present in traditional contact databases, and specialize to different use cases and verticals. \r\n\r\nWe have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts (i.e. B2B database), sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM like Clearbit, 6sense, Demandbase), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\nThis is why RevOps, sales, growth, recruiting, and outbound teams choose us over AI SDR platforms (artisan ai, 11x, amplemarket, reply.io, unify gtm, penguin ai, regie ai, aisdr, artisan sdr, outreach io, and warmly ai), existing lead databases (email enrichment, bulk email finder, or phone enrichment tools like apollo, zoominfo, leadIQ), and contact enrichment tools (clay, persana ai) that promise automation and enrichment but deliver poor results. Real sales and recruiting success comes from targeted lists and multi-channel outbound, not generic AI outreach.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\r\n\r\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.\r\n",

From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM—traditionally scattered across multiple systems—into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Instead of relying on manual prompt fiddling or guesswork, your agents get a continuous improvement loop: they’re tested, corrected, and optimized based on what your business actually requires—not what a generic model assumes.\r\nThe result is AI agents that reliably follow your domain logic, adapt to changes, and stay aligned across clients, configurations, and environments—without you needing to hand-engineer every prompt or behavior.",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\r\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies. Our vision is a world where all content, products, and policies are first simulated in an Artificial Society.

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

Our platform provides an AI co-pilot that automatically assembles context across tools, a no-code agent builder that transforms successful investigations into reusable automations, and automated report generation, providing comprehensive documentation in seconds.\r\n\r\nUnlike solutions that force teams to adapt to vendor workflows, Cotool puts the power of AI directly in practitioners' hands, letting them shape tools around their unique processes. Early users have already cut time spent on investigation and detection engineering by 70%.",

Instead of waiting for end-of-unit tests to discover gaps, teachers get continuous, real-time insight into student thinking from everyday work. Feedback becomes immediate, instruction adapts weekly, and learning iterates (measure, adjust, improve) so every student progresses faster with less teacher burnout.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was named an official White House AI Education Partner alongside OpenAI and Meta: https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/.\r\n\r\nFrizzle was co-founded by Abhay Gupta and Shyam Sai, who met in high school over 10 years ago.\r\n",

We’re taking a new approach by building everything from the ground up for AI.\r\n\r\n✨ Try building an app at floot.com\r\n\r\nExisting AI app builders fall short of enabling non-coders to build real, serious apps. They often:\r\n- Break down when building anything more than a prototype or toy app\r\n- Have non-coders stuck with errors they don’t understand\r\n- Require non-coders to handle multiple services designed for developers (e.g. for backend, database, hosting, etc)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem: these AI app builders just cobble together existing developer tools and slap AI on top, but these tools were designed for humans and not for AI.\r\n\r\nThe result? Non-coders get excited, start building, hit a wall, and then abandon their projects.\r\n\r\nFloot is purpose-built for AI. Our secret sauce:\r\n\r\n1) Instead of reusing a coding framework designed for humans, we created a specialized framework that dictates how AI should write code and how the code runs on our infrastructure. This allows us to enforce best practices, detect errors earlier, and give the best feedback to the AI. As a result, Floot can write better code and fix issues more effectively.\r\n\r\n2) Floot has the entire tech stack built-in (backend, database, hosting, etc) so building and managing an app feels seamless, especially for non-coders. And because we control every layer of the stack, we can optimize each layer for AI-first coding.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, non-coders can get more done with less time and prompting. They can finally build serious apps that work, instead of getting stuck in frustrating error loops and then abandoning their projects.\r\n\r\nWe also built a highly scalable hosting system directly on AWS so Floot apps can handle real traffic and business demands. This means non-coders can build, deploy, and scale their apps on a single platform seamlessly.\r\n\r\nPlus, Floot is really fun to use! Try building an app at floot.com",

We deploy AI agents to automate every step of the referral process that back-office staff face daily, from submitting prior authorizations to broadcasting updates and following up with patients. This frees up staff to focus on patient care.\r\n\r\nPrimary care back-offices are severely understaffed and overburdened by administrative work associated with referrals. Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in Computer Science. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in Computer Science, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google where he developed AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and have saved them over 100 hours of work in our first month live.",

Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- “Certus changed my life overnight.”\r\n- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”\r\n-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”\r\n- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”\r\n-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

That moment when an agent pauses and the illusion of intelligence breaks. The bottleneck is almost always retrieval. Each query hops across networks and databases, adding delay and cost. Moss eliminates that gap by keeping retrieval close to where the agent runs.\r\n\r\nMoss runs natively across browsers, mobile devices, and servers with an optimized vector index built in Rust and WebAssembly. It enables teams to build AI products that feel instant, contextual, and adaptive. The experiences that sustain engagement and unlock new kinds of interaction. For our customers, this translates into tangible business value: stronger user retention, higher conversion, and entirely new product categories made possible by real-time understanding.

    "long_description": "In emerging markets like the Philippines, open finance is still nascent. Most of the population is traditionally unbanked, banking APIs don’t exist, and a borrower’s financial history lives in documents: e-wallet records, bank statements, utility bills, and more. Because this data is unstructured, credit and risk teams are forced into manual review. This slows decisioning, increases costs, and caps lending volume. Legacy OCR solutions break on noisy, real-world files from these markets and still require human verification.\r\n\r\nKita is the first document intelligence platform built specifically for lending in emerging markets. We are hyperlocalized around the signals that actually drive lending outcomes in markets like the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico, and beyond. Using a layered system led by vision-language models and computer vision, we outperform traditional OCR by transforming messy borrower documents into fraud-checked, decision-ready signals lenders can use directly in underwriting.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, Kita is a learning system. We link document-level signals to repayment outcomes, allowing our models to continuously improve fraud detection and risk assessment over time. This creates a compounding advantage for lenders as their distinct underwriting decisions feed back into the system.\r\n\r\nWe secured a six-figure paid pilot with a Philippine lender the week we built our prototype. Since then, we’ve expanded with customers across multiple Southeast Asian markets, shipped new features continuously, and grown roughly 30% MoM.\r\n\r\nWe’re Carmel and Rhea. We met before Stanford and have been building together ever since. Carmel is from Manila, is a repeat founder, and spent three years in product at Apple. Rhea has a research background in computer vision and received the highest honor in Stanford Computer Science. Together, we combine deep local context with strong technical execution to build the infrastructure that expands access to credit in emerging markets.",

Fleets still run under 60% utilization, most branches lack after-hours coverage, and the aftermarket is largely reactive.
