This technology leverages a novel sensor platform we spun out of the University of Michigan. PreDxion Bio has received FDA Breakthrough Device designation and partnered with top pharmcos to monitor the immune response following CAR-T therapy and predict the development of cytokine release syndrome and neurological AEs, and for use in guiding precision medicine approaches in critical care.",
