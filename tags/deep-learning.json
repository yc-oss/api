Deep Lake powers foundational model training by acting as a vector database with significant benefits, such as (1) the ability to use multi-modal datasets to fine-tune your own LLM models, (2) storing both the embeddings and the original data with automatic version control, so no embedding re-computation is needed (3) truly serverless service with no vendor lock-in. How cool is that?\r\n\r\nGitHub loves us - we're one of the fastest-growing libraries there, and we're used by little-known companies like Google, Waymo, and Intel. No big deal. \r\n\r\nOur founding team hails from places like Princeton, Stanford, Google, and Tesla, and we're backed by Y Combinator & other Silicon Valley heavyweights. \r\n\r\nActiveloop is hiring, and we want you!

The $6 trillion chemical industry is flawed: It produces 20% of industrial greenhouse gases, and is responsible for 15% of global energy usage. \r\n\r\nEnzymes offer a far more sustainable alternative to chemical synthesis and have already revolutionised how a select few chemicals are produced. The problem is each enzyme takes years of trial and error to develop. Our enzyme models learn the principles of catalysis, allowing us to design enzymes for each reaction, in days not years. \r\n\r\nWe currently have $4.3M of LOIs and have completed our first $20k contract.

Designing a new therapeutic can take decades and billions of dollars, and even our best industrial catalysts work at a snail’s pace compared to their theoretical optimums.\r\n\r\nAnthrogen is changing that. By training massive AI foundation models on protein sequences and structures, we’ve unlocked the ability to generate—on demand—completely novel molecular machines with atomic-level precision. Simply describe the function you need, and our platform imagines the peptide or protein that will deliver it.\r\n\r\nWe're building models to speed up billions of years of evolution into the span of an afternoon's worth of compute.\r\n\r\nThe result? New-to-nature therapies, ultra-efficient catalysts for sustainable manufacturing, and a whole new frontier of molecular innovation—designed as precisely as any cutting-edge aircraft or microchip.",

It can complete tasks across internal tools and 300+ apps using MCP servers, such as Apollo, Slack, Gmail, Notion, etc. It can take over many self-contained tasks, giving your team longer legs to run faster. It runs entirely in the cloud. This means that you can have swarms of agents completing hundreds of tasks while you’re focusing on what really matters.\r\n\r\nYou can connect Zero to the applications you use or your custom MCP servers, and then just give it any task and watch it work for you. Zero is engineered to think deeply, execute complex tasks, and even maintain a personalized memory of your interactions.\r\n\r\nA few notable features:\r\n- Built-in autonomy levels, permissions, guardrails, and human approvals\r\n- Custom instructions to teach Zero how to do things your way\r\n- Automations e.g. run a task every day or whenever I receive an email\r\n- Connect to your custom MCPs\r\n- Connect to 300+ apps with one-click integrations\r\n- Natively integrates deep research and browser use",
