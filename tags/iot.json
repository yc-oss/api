It requires seeing problems early, understanding them deeply, and acting in real time, something factories were never designed to do.\r\n\r\nAt Overview.ai, we’re changing that. We build custom hardware, edge AI, and software systems that give manufacturers real visibility into how their products are actually being made. Our technology helps catch defects earlier, reduce waste, and fundamentally improve how factories operate. This work matters, not just for our customers, but for keeping American manufacturing competitive in a world that’s moving faster every year.",
