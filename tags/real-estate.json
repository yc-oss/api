Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures.\r\n\r\nInvestors can browse a variety of individual real estate properties ranging from commercial strip malls, a HELOC in someone's house, Airbnbs, to a single-family rental properties, and directly purchase ownership in these properties in under 5 minutes. There is no lockup period. Users can constantly trade these ownerships with others on the marketplace.\r\n\r\nInvestors truly legally own the properties they invested in and co-manage it with other investors through an online governance program. Owners have so far voted on how to handle various repairs, delinquent tenants, the sale of the underlying property, and much more.\r\n\r\nLofty never custodies or handles user funds or assets. Through smart-contracts on the blockchain, all transactions are directly peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed, we'll have built the NASDAQ for real estate and transformed how real estate is bought and sold in the USA.",

    "long_description": "Scout Out helps clients hire the right builder by turning building plans into fast, comparable bids.\r\n\r\nToday, every contractor who wants to bid on a project has to independently estimate material and labor quantities. That makes bidding slow, expensive, and inconsistent — and homeowners often end up comparing apples to oranges.\r\n\r\nScout Out automates this step. We use computer vision trained on building plans to generate standardized material and labor takeoffs once, in-house. We then share those takeoffs with vetted contractors, so everyone is bidding on the same scope.\r\n\r\nThe result: homeowners get more bids, faster turnaround, and clearer pricing — without asking each contractor to redo the same estimation work.\r\n\r\nWe’re starting in Los Angeles, helping homeowners rebuild after the Palisades and Eaton fires.",
