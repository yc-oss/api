For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

A good analogy is to how humans use computers: once we get used to an app, we use it much faster, while still adapting to random popups and crashes. This new paradigm for computer use will be needed by every company automating human workflows on computers.\r\n\r\nMahmoud previously built robotic process automation solutions impacting 20K+ employees at a Fortune 100 company. He also built AI & ML solutions at Baylor College of Medicine Neuroscience & Texas Children's Hospital + co-published a paper at the Rice Networks Group. \r\n\r\nAlan is ex-NASA and previously dropped out to be the first founding engineer at a PearX startup. He is a second time founder, having previously built and scaled a consumer AI app to thousands of paying users.\r\n\r\nComputer-use agents will automate the $6T dollars spent on enterprise knowledge work and Cyberdesk will be the platform to power this.\r\n\r\nWe’d love to talk with you!\r\nhttps://cal.com/mahmoud-al-madi-klrs5s/30min",

Despite rising R&D, trial timelines have increased 33% over the last decade. Accelerating clinical timelines by 20% unlocks hundreds of millions in additional revenue per drug by extending patent life. \r\n\r\nGeneric AI fails in pharma due to a lack of traceability, with only 28% of pilots reaching production - the FDA requires traceability for all claims. Our proprietary engine solves this with word-level traceability, linking every generated sentence to clinical evidence. We deploy 100% on-premise to keep sensitive patient data within the client's infrastructure, making us a trusted AI partner for pharma.\r\n\r\nWe automate the most complex parts of CSRs (clinical narratives and biostatistical analysis). Our high-quality output, validated by senior regulatory writers, costs 1/100th of human writing.
