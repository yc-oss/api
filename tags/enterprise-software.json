For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Our customers can evaluate 10x more deals and fund better companies which leads directly to better returns/more alpha.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOur system is the first of its kind to instantly generate complex, comprehensive data packs from raw data in any format, directly from the data room. This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\r\n--\r\n\r\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows. This isn’t just automation—it’s a purpose-built solution that uncovers actionable insights, fueling smarter decisions and driving true alpha.\r\n\r\n",

Events come with inherent complexity—they encode something happening rather than something being (i.e., state).\r\n\r\nOur approach is based on replication, where state is transferred directly instead of requiring a back-and-forth conversion to events. We provide primitives to enable teams to break data silos, while keeping in mind data ownership and provenance. Teams define what data their backend publishes and requires, and we'll make sure everything is reactively up-to-date. ReJot works on top of existing infrastructure such as Postgres.\r\n",

But we don't stop at phone calls; we also optimize dealerships for AI-powered search, ensuring they get found when customers search for \"car dealerships near me\" on ChatGPT and similar platforms.\r\n\r\nThe result: No more missed opportunities, no more losing customers to competitors.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.\r\n\r\nWe're not just answering phones, we're helping dealerships win in an AI-first world where availability and discoverability determine who gets the sale.",
