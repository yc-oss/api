Our work has been featured in The New York Times, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Fast Company, and many more.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Impactive will expand its platform further into nonprofit, advocacy, and additional markets. This will be an exciting time to play a critical role in helping shape the direction for what’s coming next.
