It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases.\r\n\r\nMezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\r\n\r\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\r\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\r\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\r\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\r\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\r\n\r\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.\r\n",

    "long_description": "sieve solves data cleaning for hedge funds and investment firms by letting them get clean data in four lines of code. Currently, their data pipelines have conditions that raise for human review, which literally send an email to engineers with data that needs to be reviewed. We provide an API that integrates directly into their existing pipeline - instead of raising for human review, they can send all the same information to our API and get clean, high-quality data back.\r\n\r\nBy using our AI agents built specifically for financial data collection, along with expert-in-the-loop review, we provide our clients with clean, validated data at a scale and level of quality that wasn't achievable before.",
