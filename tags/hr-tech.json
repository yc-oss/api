After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",
