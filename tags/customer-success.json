It hosts your meetings, onboarding, and integrates tools like DocuSign to give buyers a seamless path from first call to signed contract\r\n\r\nHundreds of sales calls are already hosted on Lyra, including several YC companies. We hit $100K ARR in our first two weeks.\r\n\r\nWe’re rethinking the sales stack from first call to signed contract.",
