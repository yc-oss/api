Drawing from research across many subfields of neuroscience, we have created a suite of cognitive tests that integrate behavioral measures with sensors for collecting biosignals.  The data we collect is unlike that of any existing personality or aptitude test, and gives us the unique ability to predict a tremendous number of traits, characteristics, and job performance measures.  We help employers find the ideal person for a job, and we help managers optimize and motivate their teams.",

As opposed to a simulation, our neuromorphic hardware is a physical artificial neural network, composed of spiking neurons and physical synapses. We combine unique electroceramic materials, nanofabrication techniques, and biologically plausible models of learning to create the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a new type of AI chip. The MN3 can possess over ten million spiking neurons per square centimeter, and uses far less power than conventional GPUs and CPUs.",
