By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find the perfect fit for their unique body types.\r\n\r\nTang came up with the idea for Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit.",

We build custom internal software to command and control the operations of the factory. \r\n\r\nRight now we are actively working on fully automating the production of laser cut parts including scheduling, material movement, laser configuration, etc. Orders will be able to come in, and our software will control the factory and output parts ready to ship. \r\n\r\n",

Customers have no idea where to find them and need help asking the right questions & providing the right info to get their job produced correctly. \r\n\r\nCutr solves discovery, pricing, payments and workflow for the woodworking market. \r\n\r\nOur users simply upload a file, accept an instant quote, and get their parts delivered. To make that possible we do the heavy lifting: filechecks, automated quoting, matchmaking, creating job packages, tracking changes & updates, logistics and payments.\r\n\r\nCutr saves time, cuts costs and ensures quality with a smooth workflow.\r\n",

Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

    "long_description": "We're building an AI powered platform for engineers that are building new robots and machines. \r\n\r\nWe allow users to invent and modify machine designs in a matter of minutes, not years. Ayna and Andy, the co-founders, met during their time at Harvard and started this in 2024 as their programs were wrapping up. We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams. We already have two paying customers in the OEM and system integrator spaces. \r\n\r\nWe are venture backed and supported by a GBP 2.5MM grant by ARIA, the UK Government's invention agency. ",

After witnessing Vedic's father's 12-hour shifts and visiting manufacturers across the US, they saw an industry trapped by legacy constraints: manual processes, skilled labor shortages, and unused automation.\r\n\r\nSAVA is building a fully integrated manufacturing system that eliminates skilled operators while delivering superior speed, quality, and economics. They're already reducing customer iteration cycles from 5-6 days to 1-2 days for companies like Pave Robotics - proving the technology works in real production environments.\r\n\r\nThey're not just replacing human operators with robots - they're building the foundation to replace an entire industry built on outdated technology with modern manufacturing intelligence.",
