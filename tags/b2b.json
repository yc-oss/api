As attention spans shrink to six seconds, brands can't afford lifeless popups, forms, or landing pages. We replace them with gamified conversion layers—quizzes, swipe games, stackers—that perform like performance marketing.\r\n\r\nAt Unity, our founding team helped personalize gameplay and ads for over 2 billion users. Now, we're bringing that behavioral insight to brand engagement, building a no-code platform where anyone can launch PlayAbly experiences in minutes. Think: instead of a \"Spin to Win,\" a match-3 game that sells your product, segments your audience, and gets 4× the opt-ins.\r\n\r\nWhy now? Retargeting costs are up. Email/SMS open rates are down. And today’s customers are conditioned by the dopamine loops of TikTok and mobile games. Generic funnels can’t compete—but interactive ones can.\r\n\r\nPlayAbly is already driving results:\r\n\r\nClasskick (B2B): 5× ROI, 3× higher email open rates\r\n\r\nSkout Snacks (DTC): 7× ROI, 20% higher AOV, 4× opt-in rates\r\n\r\n89% of previously lost sessions re-engaged through PlayAbly games\r\n\r\nWe monetize on a usage + performance model, enabling fast adoption and deep long-term value. We're building a new category: AI-powered gamification that converts attention into intent, on any surface where customers meet brands.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.playably.ai",

We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",

We get to personally know the top tech leaders who are interested in joining product teams in the US for the long-term.

After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",

We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n🤕 The Problem:\r\nKeeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.\r\n\r\nSerious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.\r\n\r\n✅ Problem Solved:\r\nProtex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.\r\n\r\nThe platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.\r\n\r\nProtex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.\r\n\r\nHS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.\r\n\r\nThe tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",

To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.

This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.\r\n\r\nAttain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reach out at founders@joinattain.com!",

This is forcing B2B companies - who sell products to teams, not individuals - to augment their default customer support platform (Zendesk, Intercom, Front, etc) with a second, \"unofficial\", system: Slack's shared channels.\r\n\r\nThis causes a number of operational and logistical difficulties for both vendors and their customers, resulting in added costs, inefficiencies, and lost opportunities.\r\n\r\nWith Fogbender, B2B vendors embed a team-to-team messaging widget directly on their customer dashboard, where all users belonging to an account can - with no additional authentication - 1) see a list of currently-open issues 2) participate in conversations with their own team and the vendor, and 3) search all historical discussions.",

Tailor is modular, headless, and easy to adapt.\r\n🧩 Point solutions don’t scale: Tools like inventory or order management software solve one problem, but can’t talk to each other or keep up with growth.\r\n📊 Spreadsheets are everywhere: From demand planning to purchase orders, even $100M+ brands still rely on Excel. Tailor replaces duct-taped workflows with ops modules you can tweak, combine, or scale\r\n⚡️ Complex workflows need custom logic: Whether it's multi-location inventory, DTC + B2B orders, or light manufacturing (like kitting or lot tracking), Tailor supports flexible automations out of the box.\r\n👟 Operators can move faster: Launch backend modules in minutes, not months. Tailor's low-code tools let teams build, automate, and adapt without waiting on engineering or implementation agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilt for composable retail:\r\n- Headless backend with GraphQL APIs\r\n- 50+ integrations (Shopify, QuickBooks, 3PLs, etc.)\r\n- Custom automations via Pipelines, Functions, and Event Triggers\r\n- State machines for approvals and multi-step workflows\r\n- AI features like OCR and vector search built in\r\n\r\nTailor is already powering operations at fast-growing omnichannel brands and modern manufacturers.\r\nWe’re proud to be the first Japan-based company to join Y Combinator. \r\n\r\nLearn more at [tailor.tech](https://www.tailor.tech)\r\n",

Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries.

In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.\r\n\r\nUntil Sunlight.\r\n\r\nWith our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.\r\n\r\nThe Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!",

Our open-source intelligence platform helps organizations access, analyze, and exchange patient data while integrating with all major healthcare IT systems.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been to doctors in the US, you may have encountered the problem: how does a healthcare provider get access to your up-to-date medical history to treat you properly? Reliance on archaic methods is still the norm: typically, you or your provider need to call the facilities where you’ve previously received treatment (assuming you remember them all), just to have them send your records via fax (yep, fax). This can take weeks, only then to have a provider sift through hundreds of pages of unstructured docs, just to figure out basic things like your active medication list, what conditions you may have, latest lab results, etc. This not only delays care—it can cause improper treatment, since the medical history is critical for informing treatment decisions. \r\n\r\nMetriport integrates fragmented medical data from thousands of sources—including both national and state/regional Health Information Exchanges (HIEs), ADTs, EHRs, pharmacies, and labs—through a single API connector. The platform then standardizes, deduplicates, and enriches this data to create a comprehensive longitudinal patient record, with AI-powered clinical summaries. \r\n\r\nAlong with a rich understanding of patient health history, healthcare providers also get realtime updates about their patients' health through Metriport. This includes getting notified when a patient is discharged from the hospital, picks up their prescription from the pharmacy, or has a new lab result available. Through this data, care teams get insights across their patient population, helping with 30-day readmissions prediction, care gap closure, risk adjustment, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, Metriport enables healthcare organizations to share net-new clinical information back to all major healthcare IT systems, and to become interoperable with popular EHR systems such as Epic, Cerner, athena, eClinicalWorks, and many more—forming an internet for healthcare data.\r\n\r\nMetriport improves both patient and provider lives at the point-of-care, supporting use cases such as medication adherence, transitions of care management, chart prep, and much more.

With LinkGrep you'll never have to manually add or save a link.\r\n2. 🔍 Find information that matters. LinkGrep connects with your existing tools like Notion and Slack and will automatically suggest relevant information to you as your browse (we have semantic search that you can fallback on). Demo: https://youtu.be/jwcPGDRy4oQ\r\n3. 👥 Collaborate better. LinkGrep lets you leave notes and comments directly on web pages — you won't ever have to copy paste a link into Slack ever again. \r\n4. 🤖 Automate team actions like opening up the right links before a meeting.

Previously, we all worked together at our last YC-backed startup, building it to over $6M in revenue. It was there that we placed thousands of purchase orders with wholesalers.\r\n\r\nWe realized that almost every physical product comes from B2B sales in the supply chain. However, it turns out that most of these operations are still done manually through phone and email, involving tasks like quoting, taking orders, collecting payments, entering data into ERPs, and providing support. By automating these tasks with AI agents in a human-like manner, we are creating a massive opportunity to convert $100B of payroll expenses into software spending.\r\n",

From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole—leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don’t connect to CX systems—forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences—without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",

This enables SMB installers to drastically cut down the pre-installation phase of home energy projects—from several weeks to just minutes. By leveraging LiDAR for spatial analysis, computer vision for automated assessment, and AI for system recommendations, we streamline the entire workflow. This results in a time reduction of up to 90%, enabling installers to confidently transition to and scale up sustainable home energy solutions.",

For carriers, integrating Oway can immediately increase annual revenues by up to 30% with almost no impact to existing delivery schedules.\r\n\r\nIn a technical sense, Oway applies stochastic spread optimization and real-time liquidity modeling to dynamically price freight shipments, effectively functioning as a decentralized market maker optimizing expected value across variable supply constraints.

For example, anyone with the title of \"Software Engineer\" should be in the #eng slack channel and eng@ google group.\r\n• On-call: Schedule smart rotations that take into account balancing the load and using signals from calendar schedules to make sure you don't waste time figuring out who can cover what in a fair way.

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM—traditionally scattered across multiple systems—into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

Quanstruct is available as a cloud service to start, targeting technical writers, content writing, professional services, and product teams.\r\n\r\nTraditional generative AI tools risk hallucinating critical API & SDK fields, even with RAG based approaches.

In the functions where agents aren’t yet intelligent enough to replace humans, they will be soon.\r\n\r\nWhen every human function required to operate a software product has an AI agent equivalent, the next step will be within reach: operating an entire company with a team of AI agents instead of humans.\r\n\r\nBut superintelligent agents within each function won’t be enough. To operate a software company with 0 human employees, the agents will need to be directed towards common goals, integrated to collaborate across functions, tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics, and trained to make resource allocation decisions.\r\n\r\nWe are creating the tools needed to replace the entire org chart of a software company with a team of AI agents. We are developing these tools by owning the products that we automate, because we know from 10+ years of experience building automated systems with AI/ML that integration is the key to unlocking superhuman performance.",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach because the technology infrastructure in the travel industry is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each business type and department.\r\n\r\nHotels spend hundreds of billions annually on staffing and risk losing potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling them to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.\r\n",

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other. Humans are not isolated individuals, we are social animals.\r\n\r\nWe began by simulating a network of 1,000 investors, and used it to raise a pre-seed and get into YC. Since releasing this publicly as “Wave”, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real. Artificial Societies is doing for simulations what ChatGPT did for LLMs - making them accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nAs AI advances, we will create representative models of entire human societies.

    "long_description": "Tinfoil makes it easy to make your AI workloads provably private, without changing your code. You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",

Payments take days, cost 5–10% in fees, and force companies to navigate complex banking, tax, and labor regulations. Platforms like Deel and Rippling solved this for large enterprises but remain too expensive and cumbersome for the millions of startups and growing remote teams scaling globally.\r\n\r\nShor fixes this by combining autonomous AI agents with stablecoin-based settlement. Our agents handle contracts, worker classification, compliance, and payroll automatically in a simple, messaging-first experience. Payments can settle in seconds rather than weeks at a fraction of the cost of legacy providers.\r\n\r\nWe are making global payroll fast, affordable, and accessible for the millions of companies left out by legacy platforms.",

This dramatically reduces the $735 billion universities spend annually on administrative labor, expands staff capacity without increasing headcount, and improves the student experience.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been done before because university workflows require nuanced, autonomous judgment, exactly what agentic AI was designed to solve. Our team uniquely combines deep expertise in higher education, enterprise-scale AI, and regulated enterprise sales.\r\n\r\nSadia previously built Salesforce’s Education Cloud from scratch, creating the core Student Information System widely used across higher education. She deeply understands university operations and maintains trusted relationships with hundreds of higher-ed CIOs and Provosts.\r\n\r\nDanial was one of DoorDash’s earliest engineers, where he architected and scaled complex systems from zero to billions of transactions, including their search, recommendation, and Voice AI platforms. He knows how to build robust AI solutions that reliably perform at enterprise scale. \r\n\r\nShahryar was a GM at Airwallex, where he built the entire Americas business from 0 to 1 and drove 11x revenue growth.  He’s also a master closer, single-handedly securing over $17M in enterprise deals at NerdWallet.  He’s a relentless startup executor with deep expertise launching and scaling go-to-market machines in highly regulated industries.\r\n\r\nWe launched six weeks ago and are already at $8k MRR, growing 55% week-over-week -- one of the fastest ramps ever in higher ed. Universities urgently need solutions that expand labor capacity and efficiency, especially as they face unprecedented budget pressure and staffing shortages.\r\n\r\nWith unmatched buyer access, deep technical expertise, and rapid early traction, we are perfectly positioned to own this enormous market.",

Analysts jump between tools, manually stitch together context, and make judgment calls under pressure, often for hundreds of alerts a week. Too much of their work is slow, repetitive, and error-prone. We're here to change that. \r\n\r\nSocratix gives fraud and risk teams AI coworkers that investigate alerts in real time, replacing manual reviews with fast, explainable decisions. Socratix agents plug into existing workflows and reason across signals just like human analysts to help teams reduce fraud losses, minimize false positives, and scale operations without scaling headcount.\r\n\r\nWe've seen this problem firsthand. At DoorDash, Riya helped save $30M+ a year by building smarter fraud detection and investigation tooling, and at Unit21, she built products for analysts that made them 3X faster. We're able to build and sell enterprise-grade software. At Cruise, Satya built scalable AI systems powering petabyte-scale data, and at LinkedIn, he built enterprise products from 0 to 1 generating $50M+ in incremental revenue. Now, the two of us are teaming up to eliminate the manual toil in fraud and risk.\r\n\r\nWe're obsessed with fraud, LLMs, real-world automation, and the messy edge cases traditional ML has trouble handling. We believe that every fraud analyst should have an AI coworker - and the future of fraud will involve combining human-level reasoning with machine-speed execution. ",

Additionally, patients suffer navigating the complex referral process, which can have disastrous health effects if they don’t get the care they need. These factors point to a glaring gap in the system—where out of over 100 million specialist referrals issued annually in the US, only half are actually completed. Locata is tackling this problem head-on, saving administrative staff hours each week and ensuring that the referral process goes as smoothly as possible for patients and their providers.\r\n\r\nAlejandro and Josh met at Stanford where they graduated with BS degrees in CS. Alejandro was a senior software engineer at Meta’s Reality Labs where he led development of several AI features for wearable products and prior to that conducted AI research at Stanford Medicine. Josh graduated with a masters in CS, specializing in AI, before working as a software engineer at Google, developing AI products that served over 1 billion users.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of building our product, we signed a major regional health center and are implementing our system to automate their entire referral workflow.",

    "long_description": "Certus AI is replacing the restaurant phone line with Voice AI.\r\n\r\nRestaurants lose up to $100,000 per year per location from missed calls, lost orders, and abandoned hold lines. Staff are overwhelmed. IVRs frustrate customers. Call centers are expensive and impersonal.\r\n\r\nIt’s 2025. Guests don’t leave voicemails or wait on hold. They just move on.\r\n\r\nCertus is an AI voice agent built for restaurants. It answers every call, 24/7 — taking orders, processing deliveries, booking reservations, upselling, and handling complaints in English, Spanish, French and more. Certus is built to manage the phone line end to end, from the customer call to the restaurant tech stack, with zero human intervention required. It currently integrates with industry-leading systems like Toast, Square, Clover, UberEats, DoorDash, and more.\r\n\r\nWe’re building the voice layer of the modern restaurant — the employee they’ll never fire.\r\n\r\nWe started Certus because we lived the pain. Gurveer (CEO) grew up answering phones in his family’s restaurant and helped operate them, growing from 1 to 11 locations in 7 years. Later, he and Adam (CRO) ran a restaurant growth startup to help others increase revenue, but kept watching clients bleed cash because no one picked up the phone. So we built the solution the industry always wished existed.\r\n\r\nUntil now, this problem was considered unsolvable. But Voice AI has finally crossed the conversational chasm and 72% of consumers now prefer AI over humans as long as it means faster and better service.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the market is begging for this. The North American restaurant industry crossed $1 trillion in 2024, and it's projected to hit $1.5 trillion in 2025. Yet over $100 billion is still lost annually to missed calls, human error, and outdated tech. As the market continues to grow, so do the losses!\r\n\r\nOur customers say it best:\r\n\r\n- “Certus changed my life overnight.”\r\n- “We were losing the ability to give great in-house service — the phone was killing us.”\r\n-  “70% of my business comes through the phone. That’s mine and my 16 staffs livelihood.”\r\n- “Before Certus, I used to lose 40 - 60 calls a day…. now my printer just stays printing!”\r\n-  “I’ve been in the business 38 years. I’ve been waiting for this since then.”\r\n\r\nCertus is here to fix the $120B phone problem — one call at a time.\r\n\r\nAnd in doing so, we’re redefining how the restaurant industry communicates forever, starting with the phone line.",

We're starting by helping the ag and mining industry track stockpiles of grain and gravel.\r\n\r\nBulk inventory tracking is broken. Companies either rely on guesstimates or pay for expensive manual surveys which are still off by 20 to 30%. Without accurate numbers, it’s hard to plan logistics, like how many truckloads are needed. And it creates accounting issues by misreporting inventory value, hurting financial planning and leading to missed opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe’ve lived this problem, and we know how to solve it. Warren saw it firsthand as a Product Manager at Milk Moovement, a $20M Series A AgTech startup, working closely with feed suppliers and farm managers. Jordan scaled Microsoft Azure’s largest public API, handling over 700M requests/month, and sold software to a public company. Cole was engineer #3 at Tropic, scaling it from seed to Series B, and later led engineering at an AI startup.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built an integrated hardware and software platform and have signed one of the largest agricultural company in North America. As industries demand real-time visibility into the physical world, dScribe AI is positioned to become the system of record for inventory that don’t fit in traditional boxes and barcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
