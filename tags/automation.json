In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

We make swarms of small mobile robots that install into existing warehouses to provide a low-cost and robust automation solution for case picking and mixed-SKU palletization. Our novel technology allows these robots to be installed and operate at significantly lower cost than existing solutions while being both flexible and robust.",

Missing after-hours calls alone costs the average dealership $1M annually in lost revenue.\r\n\r\nWe built Flai to fix this - AI assistants that answer dealership calls 24/7, scheduling test drives, oil changes, or running outbound recall campaigns so no opportunity slips away.\r\n\r\nThe result: No more missed opportunities, no more losing customers to competitors.\r\n\r\nOur founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.\r\n\r\nWe're not just answering phones, we're helping dealerships win in an AI-first world where availability determine who gets the sale.",
