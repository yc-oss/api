    "long_description": "We’re building modular strike and reconnaissance drone platforms and a corresponding super-easy-to-use swarm control system in collaboration with Royal Marine Commandos, US, and allied nations, to fill a capability gap.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because modern conflict has led to a shift in the procurement landscape. It’s now possible to work directly with military units to build what they need, which is exactly what we’ve been doing at Seeing Systems.\r\n\r\nThink of us as Anduril, but with worse weather, and better banter.",
