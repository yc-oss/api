We as first movers developed a bookkeeping app that would help any merchant sitting at the remotest corner of the country with internet connectivity to record his transactions digitally. We helped them track the credit given to their customers and suppliers. With our Okcredit app a merchant can track the amount of credit given, monitor credit limit, send reminders and eventually can collect faster from their customers.

    "long_description": "malibou is a web application helping French SMBs to manage employees, run payroll and track compliance in a single app.\r\n\r\nWhen processing payroll in France, you either have the choice between an accountant with good advice but no way to connect an HRIS with him, or a good HRIS that does not include payroll services. It was time for a change, to finally bring payroll and HR at the same place. \r\n\r\nDue to increasing competition in the space, French payroll engines have just opened their APIs. This allows us to offer a unified payroll and HR solution, which wasn't possible before.",

It answers product questions, supports customers with orders, follows up on abandoned checkouts, restocks, and repeat purchases, and even runs marketing campaigns. Brands simply connect Boom to their store, and their AI agent instantly starts selling, supporting, and following up like a real team member — no setup or flow-building required.\r\n\r\nE-commerce is a $6T market where brands spend heavily to bring customers in, only to lose over 99% of them before checkout. Boom fixes that by turning every missed conversation into a sales opportunity. Our clients increase conversion rates and deliver a concierge-like buying experience at scale. We believe that in the near future, every online store will have AI employees managing sales and customer relationships — and Boom is building the platform that makes that possible.",
