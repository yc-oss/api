The goal is to mature these supersonic UAVs to become loyal wingmen (or collaborative combat aircraft) and eventually develop quiet supersonic airliners from the lessons learned and profits generated by the supersonic UAV product line. Founded in 2019, Exosonic has raised $4.5M+ in private capital and $2M+ in AFWERX funding. The team has 15 FTEs and is developing a subscale flight test vehicle to demonstrate autonomy and potentially crewed-uncrewed teaming with a first flight timeframe of Q2 2023. ",
