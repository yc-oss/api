Supplant™ sugars from fiber is a brand-new blend of sugars found naturally in plant fiber. With Supplant™ sugars from fiber, your favorite treats can look, feel and taste like they’re supposed to. Because it’s made from fiber, Supplant™ sugars from fiber is lower in calories, has a lower glycemic response (compared to glucose), and is prebiotic. It’s made by upcycling agricultural side-streams. For example, in corn (maize), it’s made from the cob, not the kernel. In wheat and rice, it’s made from the straw, not the grain. These fiber-rich parts of crops are hugely abundant and don’t typically make their way into the food system.",
