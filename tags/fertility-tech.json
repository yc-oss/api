Founded at Harvard, the company has now raised $40M from leading investors like FirstMark Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Section 32, Tribe Capital, and even celebrities like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and others. \r\n\r\n**What we're doing**\r\n\r\nWe aim to change the outdated view that fertility is a \"women's issue\" by creating an accessible, affordable product for men & people with sperm. This includes everything from a mail-in kit for sperm testing & sperm freezing, personalized sperm improvement products, tele-health, DNA fragmentation analysis, supplements, and more.\r\n\r\n**Why are we the leader?** \r\n\r\nThe company was founded at Harvard by a team of healthcare and fertility experts. We obsess about talent density and have out-executed our competitors over the past few years. Beyond our D2C channel, we've also unlocked:\r\n\r\n1. Nationwide insurance coverage (10M+ lives)\r\n2. Military contracts (Including the Navy SEALs and 15M+ veterans)\r\n3. Employer offerings (Working with the top fertility benefit providers)\r\n\r\n**Tell me about the team** \r\n\r\nWe're a team of about 30, extremely diverse (majority female, majority immigrants, strong LGBQTIA+ representation, age range of 25-65), and very values driven. Our 5 values are customer centricity, reliability, kindness, openness, and winning. \r\n\r\nLearn more about our values here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/legacys-values-and-why-they-matter-db116539d3da\r\n\r\nLearn more about our workplace here:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nRead about our mission to humanize the path to parenthood:\r\nhttps://khaled-legacy.medium.com/how-and-why-legacy-is-reinventing-workplace-benefits-9e5fda6cb863\r\n\r\nLearn more about sperm and why it matters here:\r\ndocsend.com/view/zkgk7ws",
