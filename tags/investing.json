We invest in the most liquid segment of the art market, with the lowest volatility, yielding tremendous growth uncorrelated to traditional investments. Arthena’s automated and data driven investment strategy regulates art investment by building traditional fund structures. HNWI’s can now securely and confidently diversify their portfolios into alternative assets focusing on the luxury market.\r\n\r\nArthena has designed and built a statistically rigorous model that estimates the value of artwork over time. Since the data we obtain derives from auction records and repeat sales, our model relies on a set of features about each result. These features include include the artist’s name, medium, date of creation, origin of location and size of work. After identifying groups of work that are similar to each other, we calculate the expected ROI and estimated volatility based on the distribution of gains. Using historical auction results to simulate the performance of our funds, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis to determine annualized returns and sharpe ratios. Based on this analysis, Arthena can validate the financial viability of our product and establish statistically rigorous bounds for these estimates.",

Sellers can also sell a portion of their equity (starting at just 10%) instead of the entire property or create customized HELOC structures.\r\n\r\nInvestors can browse a variety of individual real estate properties ranging from commercial strip malls, a HELOC in someone's house, Airbnbs, to a single-family rental properties, and directly purchase ownership in these properties in under 5 minutes. There is no lockup period. Users can constantly trade these ownerships with others on the marketplace.\r\n\r\nInvestors truly legally own the properties they invested in and co-manage it with other investors through an online governance program. Owners have so far voted on how to handle various repairs, delinquent tenants, the sale of the underlying property, and much more.\r\n\r\nLofty never custodies or handles user funds or assets.

The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. \r\n\r\nHere’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. \r\n\r\nHowever, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor.",

Our customers can evaluate 10x more deals and fund better companies which leads directly to better returns/more alpha.\r\n--\r\n\r\nOur system is the first of its kind to instantly generate complex, comprehensive data packs from raw data in any format, directly from the data room. This enables investors to gain an 80% understanding of a potential deal within moments, empowering them to say No to a deal earlier in the process and focus on high-potential opportunities. Traditionally, creating these detailed data packs—like cohort or retention analyses and customer roll-forwards—takes weeks, during which critical details may be overlooked, potentially costing funds millions in missed insights and poor decisions.\r\n--\r\n\r\nKeye combines cutting-edge AI with deep private equity expertise to deliver powerful, multi-layered insights that go far beyond the simple summarizers and search functions offered by other tools. Our platform dives deep into both quantitative and qualitative due diligence data, offering high-impact analytics crafted specifically for private equity workflows. This isn’t just automation—it’s a purpose-built solution that uncovers actionable insights, fueling smarter decisions and driving true alpha.\r\n\r\n",
