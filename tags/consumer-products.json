Our platform technology, AesculaGel offers adaptive response to a wide range of stimuli and can be tailor-made for biocompatibility, material strength, and a range of other attributes. \r\n\r\nFounded by one of MIT's 35 under 35 Innovators, AesculaTech is the shared vision of scientists, engineers, and medical experts. Our cornerstone product, Humidifeye, is an ophthalmic platform to treat dry eye disease. Dry eye affects more than 25 million Americans and the global treatment market is projected higher than $6 Billion within the next decade. Our thermally responsive, form-fitting materials are suitable for sustained yet reversible occlusion across a range of treatment times. In contrast to existing technologies, our product will not extrude, or cause discomfort as it adapts to patients. Though Humidifeye is not yet FDA approved, expect to hear about it soon!\r\n\r\nIn coordination with partners across several sectors, we have a variety of groundbreaking technologies in the works that live up to our vision. This work has already been recognized. AesculaTech was named a Rosenman Innovator, received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, was a finalist in the 2019 Octane High Tech Awards, and is a graduate of both the Y Combinator and TMCx accelerator programs. In short, Y-Combinator was only the beginning. \r\n\r\n",

    "long_description": "ThirdLayer is an applied research and product lab building the next interface for human–AI collaboration.\r\n\r\nOur first product is Dex, an AI copilot for the browser. Think Cursor for knowledge work, optimized for speed and embedded directly where you work.\r\n\r\nMost web agents are built for set-and-forget tasks. But real work is fluid and messy—spread across tabs, tools, and evolving decisions. Dex transforms your browser into an intelligent, multimodal workspace that understands your intent through voice, text, and action. It enhances familiar interfaces, automates tedious steps, and removes the friction of handoffs.\r\n\r\nBeneath the surface, Dex is more than a browser agent — it’s a foundation for:\r\n\r\n● Long-term, cross-modal memory grounded in real workflows\r\n● A new interaction layer to replace static UI with a collaborative canvas \r\n● Personalization: understanding how individuals approach tasks and navigate software\r\n\r\nWe're building the infrastructure for adaptive, intent-aware systems that work the way you do.",
