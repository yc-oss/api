In doing so, they created a vertical farming technology capable of growing lettuces, spinach, basil, carrots, lavender, and more.\r\n\r\nBeanstalk is at the nexus of industrial robotics, plant science, and the culinary arts. Our technology enables us to develop new products quickly, automate traditionally labor-intensive work, and connect consumers to fresh produce in ways not before seen.",
