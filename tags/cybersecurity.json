From there, Stacksi parses their documents, identifies gaps in their security policies vs. standards, and helps them establish a successful security program. \r\nUltimately, we will help them 1) automate completion of security questionnaires, 2) quickly get through enterprise security audits and 3) improve their security posture.",

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe’ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don’t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA’s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil’s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don’t log your queries.” Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user — not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it’s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating “God in a box”, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can’t spy.",

A growing number of high-profile \"AI agent gone rogue\" security incidents make headlines each week.\r\n\r\nAs enterprise adoption of agentic software has far outpaced the development of applicable cybersecurity solutions, CISOs have loudly voiced a growing need for verifiable, fine-grained security controls on complex multi-agent systems. That's why we built Multifactor.\r\n\r\nMultifactor offers best-in-class authentication, authorization, and auditing technologies for agentic systems, allowing users to securely and revocably share online accounts with agents while maintaining fine-grained permissions and a detailed event history. We are doing for AI security what Cloudflare did for web security, Okta did for identity security, and Wiz did for cloud security: defining the category.\r\n\r\nA world-class \"account manager\" that allows agents to securely use online accounts on your behalf is just the start—our early enterprise partners include companies using AI agents to manage $7.5+ billion manufacturing supply chains, where the consequences for lapses in security are severe. Our patented AI security technology seamlessly integrates with existing agentic software to thwart attacks like prompt injection, so CISOs and end users alike can breathe a sigh of relief, without slowing the pace of AI adoption.",
