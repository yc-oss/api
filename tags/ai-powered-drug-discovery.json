It’s why in 2014, Dr. Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen started Qvin to research, develop, and patent a product that powers an underserved and understudied population—women.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of the decisions our doctors make are influenced by blood test results.  Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. However, the blood our bodies naturally deliver every month has never been explored as a testing source. And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored.\r\n\r\nQvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.\r\n\r\nOur health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.\r\n\r\nAll of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward.

This is poised to be a best-in-class, potentially breakthrough therapy for treating iron deficiency without any GI side-effects (eg. nausea, constipation, diarrhea, etc.) typically associated with oral iron supplements, and without the risks, costs and side-effects associated with IV iron infusions. When approved, Keylika’s proprietary transdermal iron will be the world's first prescription iron patch.

    "long_description": "Reticular helps pharma companies discover drugs with AI models like AlphaFold by making them steerable, just like you can prompt LLMs. Today, limited validation data means companies spend millions on failed experiments trying to steer these models through trial and error. We’re piloting our AI interpretability technology with early-stage biotechs and scaling rapidly. Just a week after our pivot, we identified the first interpretable features ever found in protein models, allowing precise control over biological functions.\r\n\r\nNithin and John met competing in Biology Olympiads before spending 4 years as roommates at MIT publishing ML/bio research in NeurIPS and Nature. We believe biological models encode far more information than anyone is currently using - our goal is to unlock this potential.",

Our model powers applications across the entire R&D pipeline, from designing better drugs to running smarter clinical trials. \r\n\r\nOur first model is state-of-the-art in mRNA property prediction. It simulates costly experiments, helping partners design more effective mRNA medicines faster and cheaper. Our open-source models are being used by Sanofi & GSK. We’re also collaborating with the Arc Institute to bring our RNA embeddings into the next generation of virtual cell models. \r\n\r\nmRNA design is just the beginning. As the model improves, we’re extending to applications like target ID, novel biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and more. We’ve spent decades applying machine learning to biology across academia (PhDs at the University of Toronto) and industry (Recursion, Deep Genomics, Amazon). \r\n\r\nContact us to learn more: founders@blank.bio ",
