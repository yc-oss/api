We've built the most robust application for collaboratively reviewing complex facilities on the web and on wireless VR devices like the Oculus Quest. Our customers love it because it just works even with complex 3D building models.\r\n\r\nFrom data centers to cutting-edge biopharma facilities, Resolve provides a collaborative virtual environment for operations & maintenance teams to review and interact with 3D building models at full scale - decreasing late stage changes during the construction process and delivering a safer, more easily operable building.\r\n\r\nOur customers' facilities contain a multitude of complex systems which require careful coordination and review to ensure the building is completed on time and within budget. To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

Their mission is to have a positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the housing crisis through their sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms. They started by inventing a new material that is a 3D printing tech that enabled printing of an entire building, not just walls, in a single cycle. Unlike concrete, Mighty Buildings’ material is lighter, can be uniquely treated (trimmed and cut) by robotic arms, and features high thermal insulation properties. This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.\r\n\r\nMighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.\r\n\r\nThe company is certified under California's Factory Built Housing program to build units using 3D-printing, but they are also the first company to achieve certification under the UL 3401 standard for evaluating building structures and assemblies.",

This labor is used for a building’s: structure, vapor barriers, windows, insulation, siding, roofing, electrical, plumbing, fixtures, appliances, and cabinetry. The construction industry solves this complex variety of tasks by dividing them among tiny companies of specialized artisans. Few lessons learned are shared and the industry has had no growth in labor productivity since 1947.\r\n\r\nBuilding technology, methods, and materials have advanced and the constraints limiting home manufacturing can now be removed. Regulations have changed to allow small and simple accessory dwelling units (a.k.a. ADUs or backyard homes), making it easier to mass-produce housing. Pippin started in the ADU market with its brand \"Rent the Backyard\" and will build duplexes, quadplexes, and eventually large apartment buildings.",

Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality. \r\n\r\nThe idea was born out of Abdullah's experience as a mechanical design team member, where he created thousands of drawings and longed for a more efficient process. Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise.

    "long_description": "Opusense AI automates field report writing for construction field inspectors. Instead of typing up notes at the end of the day, inspectors can now walk a site, speak observations aloud, snap photos, and let our AI assistant generate a detailed, organized report on-site and in real time.\r\n\r\nCombined, the founding team has over 15 years in the construction industry. Writing up these field reports used to take up at least 20% of the week. With Opusense, we cut that time by 5x. Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn’t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive. Every inspection firm and contractor is struggling with documentation. Manual reports slow them down, create inconsistencies, and delay handoffs. We believe AI can do this better, and Opusense is proving it.",
